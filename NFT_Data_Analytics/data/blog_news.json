    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Yuga Labs co-founder Wylie Aronow postpones return due to ongoing health recovery, prioritizing long-term well-being. Aronow, aka Gordon Goner, maintains a board role and strategic advisory position despite a congestive heart failure diagnosis. Despite health challenges, Aronow actively observes Yuga Labs’ operations, identifying key issues and suggesting changes. NFT entrepreneur Wylie Aronow, co-founder of Yuga Labs, has officially addressed rumors about his potential return to the NFT firm. Despite making steady progress in his health recovery, Aronow has firmly stated that he is not yet ready to return, emphasizing the importance of ensuring his long-term well-being. Aronow, who also goes by the name Gordon Goner, had taken a leave of absence from Yuga Labs in late January due to a congestive heart failure diagnosis. At that time, he clarified that he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser to the company. In his recent statement, Aronow revealed the unpredictable nature of his health journey, describing days when he feels ready to dive back into work and others when he feels the need for immediate medical attention. While he has been away, Aronow has been watching Yuga Labs’ operations, responsible for popular NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks. He has identified key issues hindering the company’s progress and has suggested necessary changes during board meetings. Despite his absence, Aronow expressed confidence in the current leadership of Yuga Labs, especially as the company faces a critical year in 2024. He believes the team is well-prepared to meet the challenges and impress the community. Before stepping back, Aronow acknowledged that he had pushed himself to the limits, working long hours nearly every day. He admitted that he should have heeded the advice of those around him and sought a better work-life balance. Yuga Labs has not stood still during Aronow’s absence, appointing Daniel Alegre, the former president and chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard, as its new CEO about a month before Aronow’s leave. In February 2021, Aronow co-founded Yuga Labs alongside Greg Solano, Zeshan Ali, and Kerem Atalay. The company’s portfolio includes notable NFTs such as CryptoPunks, BAYC, MeeBits, and Othersidemeta. Aronow’s commitment to his health and support to Yuga Labs from the sidelines highlight the resilience and determination of the entrepreneur and the NFT industry in navigating challenges and uncertainties.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://www.todaynftnews.com/south-korea-exempts-nfts-and-cbdcs-from-cryptocurrency-interest-mandate/",
    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Starting July 2024, South Korea’s FSC will enable investors to earn interest on digital asset deposits in exchanges. The directive excludes nonfungible tokens and central bank digital currencies from earning interest. Exchanges must segregate user deposits, entrust them to banks, and store 80% of coins in cold wallets. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has issued a new directive that will impact digital asset investors and exchanges in the country. According to the FSC’s notice, starting from July 2024, investors who deposit their digital assets into exchanges will be entitled to receive interest on their deposits. This move is part of South Korea’s efforts to regulate the crypto space more comprehensively. However, there are exceptions to this new rule. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been excluded from the mandate. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs reflects the unique nature of these digital assets, which may not fit the criteria for interest-bearing deposits. Interestingly, the FSC has left room for potential exceptions to this exclusion. If certain NFTs are categorized as payment methods and are issued in significant quantities, they may be reclassified as virtual assets and become eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. This shows the regulator’s flexibility in adapting to the evolving landscape of digital assets. In addition to addressing interest on deposits, the FSC has also laid out guidelines for the safe handling of user deposits by virtual asset operators. Exchanges are now required to segregate user deposits from their own assets and entrust them to a bank. Furthermore, a substantial portion, specifically 80%, of the coins must be stored in a secure cold wallet, enhancing security measures. The FSC’s directive also covers preparations for potential hacks or computer incidents. Virtual asset service providers are mandated to either acquire insurance or accumulate reserves to mitigate the impact of such incidents. Additionally, the new law prohibits exchanges from blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it is deemed absolutely necessary and authorized by the courts or financial regulators. South Korea has been actively solidifying its regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier in December, financial regulators called on users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges operating within the country. This initiative was led by the Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea. As South Korea continues to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, these regulatory changes aim to strike a balance between investor protection and industry growth. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs, while allowing for potential exceptions, highlights the need for flexible and nuanced regulation in the world of cryptocurrencies.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK The trading volume of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is approaching a significant milestone, nearing $1 billion in total value. A substantial 125% increase in NFT trading activity occurred in November. The average transaction value of NFTs has significantly risen, indicating a growing market interest and value. In a compelling turn of events, the nonfungible token (NFT) market has experienced a robust surge in trading volume, approaching the $1 billion mark in November. DappRadar, a decentralized app tracking platform, released data revealing that NFT trading has embraced the bullish wave, marking the second consecutive month of upward momentum. The report from DappRadar indicates a remarkable 125% increase in NFT trading volume in November, signaling a significant shift in user behavior compared to previous downtrends in NFT activity. Notably, this surge comes amid a broader positive trend in the cryptocurrency markets. Executives within the Web3 space are optimistic about the continuation of this trend. Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of SuperRare, conveyed to Cointelegraph on November 14 that the worst of the bear market appears to be behind us, suggesting a favorable outlook for the NFT sector in the coming months. In addition to the surge in trading volume, the average value of NFT transactions experienced an impressive 114% increase, climbing from $126 to $270 throughout November. This indicates a growing confidence and willingness among participants to engage in higher-value transactions within the NFT space. DappRadar’s report also sheds light on the increased daily unique active wallets (UAW) in blockchain gaming, witnessing a 14% rise. The decentralized applications industry saw blockchain gaming with a 34% market dominance, reinforcing its status as a fundamental pillar in the decentralized ecosystem. Despite a seemingly bearish mood throughout the year, blockchain gaming projects have managed to secure a substantial $2.3 billion in investments from the beginning of 2023 up to October. This resilience is particularly evident in the third quarter of 2023, where blockchain gaming secured an impressive $600 million in investments, even amidst lower cryptocurrency market prices than previous peaks. In conclusion, the NFT market’s remarkable resurgence and the resilience of blockchain gaming investments paint a picture of a dynamic and evolving landscape within the cryptocurrency space. As the crypto markets turn bullish, these trends may signal a broader shift in user sentiment and behavior, marking a positive outlook for the industry in the months ahead.",

The plan includes the development of AI-enhanced and blockchain-supported games and digital experiences. This initiative brings Reebok’s styles into the digital world as wearable NFTs and emphasizes creating immersive virtual gaming experiences. A critical project in this partnership is “Reebok Impact,” which is slated for launch next year. This initiative is described as a “mind and heart-bending digital shoe experience” that integrates AI technology with on-chain digital wearables. The goal is to illustrate that life’s essence is not just about the sneakers one wears but about one’s experiences while wearing them. Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky highlighted the importance of participating in the world purposefully, and this partnership with Futureverse is seen as a step towards redefining the limits of innovation and consumer engagement in the digital evolution of products. Futureverse, which secured $54 million in Series A funding in July, aims to create an “open metaverse” where digital assets like NFTs can move freely across multiple platforms. The company is expanding its ecosystem by acquiring other crypto firms, games, and metaverse experiences, although this collaboration with Reebok marks its first foray into digital footwear. In comparison, Nike acquired RTFKT, an NFT sneaker studio, in December 2021, leading the footwear industry into the virtual domain. Since then, Nike has built a robust NFT community and released exclusive physical sneaker collections with digital counterparts. Following this trend, brands like Adidas, Dior, and Puma have launched similar “phygital” products. While Reebok has not announced any plans for physical sneakers linked to digital tokens yet, it has revealed a limited-edition sneaker drop in collaboration with Gary Vaynerchuk’s NFT brand VeeFriends. This special edition will initially be available to VeeFriends token holders before being released globally. Reebok’s partnership with Futureverse represents a significant move into the digital realm, blending AI and blockchain technology to create unique gaming and digital fashion experiences, potentially reshaping how consumers interact with the brand in virtual spaces.",

The issue affects pre-built contracts from Thirdweb, particularly concerning Ethereum’s ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-20 standards. OpenZeppelin, another smart contract library, confirmed that the vulnerability does not originate from their code but is helping to address the issue. In the dynamic world of Ethereum NFTs, a recent revelation about a vulnerability in Thirdweb’s smart contracts has sent ripples through the community. Thirdweb, known for its crypto development tools, disclosed a significant issue in a widely used open-source library for Web3 smart contracts. This discovery has prompted a swift response from Ethereum NFT marketplaces and creators, underscoring the urgency of securing digital assets. The vulnerability, which remains undisclosed to prevent exploitation, affects pre-built contracts provided by Thirdweb and potentially others. Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized apps and NFT collections, making this a critical concern for stakeholders. OpenZeppelin, another prominent player in smart contract libraries, clarified that the problem does not originate from its repository. Despite this, the company has committed to leading the community in identifying affected parties and offering mitigation strategies. IMPORTANT On November 20th, 2023 6pm PST, we became aware of a security vulnerability in a commonly used open-source library in the web3 industry. This impacts a variety of smart contracts across the web3 ecosystem, including some of thirdweb’s pre-built smart contracts.… — thirdweb (@thirdweb) December 5, 2023 In a proactive measure, Thirdweb advises projects to lock down their current smart contracts and transition to new ones, ensuring the safety of their collections. The firm has also pledged to support affected parties financially by covering the network fees for this migration. This recommendation comes after Thirdweb implemented a fix to its smart contract templates on November 22, ensuring that contracts deployed after this date are secure. The exploit impacts NFT smart contracts adhering to Ethereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and ERC-20 standard fungible tokens. Thirdweb’s blog post provides a detailed list of affected contract types and a tool for identifying compromised contracts. Several major industry players have weighed in on the situation. OpenSea and Rarible, leading NFT marketplaces, are exploring ways to assist collection owners with contract migrations. Coinbase revealed that some collections on its NFT platform are affected, while Manifold, a smart contract startup, confirmed its contracts are safe. Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network, acknowledged the impact on some project contracts but assured the network’s security. Ethereum profile picture project Cool Cats and Animoca Brands’ Mocaverse gaming platform are moving to new contracts to safeguard their NFT collections. In response to the challenge, Thirdweb has doubled its bug bounty payments to $50,000 and committed to a more stringent auditing process in the future.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Tiger Global’s NFT portfolio slashes reflect crypto market caution amid volatility. Coatue Management marks down OpenSea investment by 90%, echoing NFT market reevaluation. The evolving NFT space prompts major investors to recalibrate, shaping crypto’s future stability. In a significant move, Tiger Global, a prominent investment firm, has drastically reduced its investments in notable non-fungible token (NFT) projects. These investments include the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection and the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Bloomberg’s recent report reveals that Tiger Global slashed its BAYC stakes by 69% and OpenSea holdings by 94%. Moreover, the firm has also cut valuations for several other portfolio companies. Tiger Global’s decision reflects a cautious approach towards the volatile crypto market. The firm has been diversifying its investments in the crypto realm, focusing on NFTs and blockchain security and privacy-focused initiatives. In 2021, it co-led a $24 million funding round for blockchain security company CertiK, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing decentralized finance (DeFi) security. Furthermore, in 2022, Tiger Global participated in a Series B investment for Aleo, a zero-knowledge applications platform, which successfully raised $200 million. This round saw leading investors like Kora Management LP and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Additionally, the firm invested in Polygon, a layer-2 network, showcasing its broad interest in crypto. However, Tiger Global is not alone in this cautious stance. Coatue Management, another major player and co-lead investor in OpenSea, recently marked down its investment in the NFT marketplace by 90%. This reduction brought OpenSea’s valuation down to $1.4 billion, a significant decrease from its previous valuation. These markdowns by Tiger Global and Coatue Management signal a broader trend of reevaluation within the NFT market. Investors are becoming more circumspect, primarily due to fluctuating market values. Consequently, this shift could lead to more conservative investment strategies in the NFT and broader crypto sectors. Besides these adjustments, these investment giants’ moves underscore the NFT space’s evolving nature. Hence, as the market matures, further recalibrations in investments are likely. These developments may pave the way for more stable and sustainable growth in the crypto and NFT sectors in the long run.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK New research studies offer fresh insights into the NFT market, emphasizing the roles of personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and optimism. Guneet Kaur Nagpal and Luc Renneboog’s study on CryptoPunks reveals Ethereum investors’ tendencies towards higher-cost activities and gains. The research indicates that Ethereum’s market performance influences asset sale decisions more than NFT prices. In a fascinating twist in understanding the nonfungible token (NFT) market, new research studies have revealed that personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and consumer optimism play crucial roles in market dynamics. This insight emerges from a trio of studies conducted by academicians from several prestigious institutions, offering a fresh perspective on the factors influencing the NFT landscape. At the forefront of these studies, researchers Guneet Kaur Nagpal from Western University and Luc Renneboog from Tilburg University explored the market dynamics of CryptoPunks, a leading NFT asset collection. Their study, “On Nonfungible Tokens, Blockchain Hypes, and the Creation of Scarcity,” highlighted that Ethereum (ETH) investors were more inclined to engage in higher-cost market activities and experienced significant gains. Interestingly, the study noted that ETH’s market performance did not directly influence NFT prices but impacted decisions on asset sales. Meanwhile, Chuyi Sun of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill delved into how personal experiences shape market behavior in the NFT domain. In the study “Personal Experience Effects across Markets: Evidence from NFT and Cryptocurrency Investing,” Sun analyzed data from approximately one million wallets. The findings revealed that investors receiving more valuable NFTs in initial offerings were likelier to engage in subsequent NFT purchases and gravitate towards speculative cryptocurrencies. Contrastingly, a study from the Rennes School of Business, “The Impact of Experience, Overconfidence and Optimism on Future Cryptocurrency Ownership,” conducted by Akanksha Jalan and Roman Matkovskyy, brought to light an intriguing aspect of investor behavior. Contrary to expectations, negative past experiences and investor optimism positively influenced future engagements in cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This trend suggests a unique resilience among investors, attributing losses to external factors like market volatility rather than personal decision-making. These studies offer a nuanced understanding of the NFT market, moving beyond conventional economic models. They underscore the importance of personal experiences and psychological factors in driving market trends. This research paves the way for a deeper exploration of the human elements behind the burgeoning world of NFTs, suggesting that market movements are as much about individual stories and perceptions as they are about economic indicators. The recent findings challenge traditional market theories, highlighting the complex interplay of personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and optimism in shaping the future of NFTs. This new knowledge enriches our understanding of the NFT market and opens doors for more human-centric approaches to studying digital asset economies.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Bioniq emerges as a key player in cryptocurrency with a Bitcoin NFT marketplace The platform uses Internet Computer Protocol to reduce network congestion and fees. Bioniq offers contract auctions and a cross-chain wallet bridging Bitcoin and ICP. Bioniq has emerged as a pivotal player in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, launching an innovative Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace. This platform stands out for its strategic use of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), significantly reducing the network congestion and high fees often associated with Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions. Developed in the wake of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq is set to revolutionize the way Bitcoin-based NFTs are traded. Leveraging the ICP’s native Bitcoin integration, Bioniq has crafted a seamless marketplace featuring innovative contract auctions and a comprehensive cross-chain wallet bridging Bitcoin and ICP. Bob Bodily, CEO and co-founder of Bioniq emphasized the platform’s quick response to the immense potential of Ordinals, starting its development as early as February 2023. The platform’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Bioniq introduces an intelligent wallet, enabling users to manage their private keys through Web3Auth. This feature brings the convenience of logging in via standard Web2 Google accounts while retaining noncustodial control over wallets and assets. Furthermore, Bioniq capitalizes on the advantages of partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) integrated within the ICP’s Bitcoin network. This integration allows for smart contract capabilities directly on Bitcoin, bypassing the need for centralized cross-chain bridges. Backed by influential names like Polychain Capital, Bioniq takes a unique approach by treating Internet Computers as a Bitcoin layer-2 network. This strategy harnesses the ICP’s efficiencies in time and cost through a token-wrapping process. Users can transfer their Bitcoin and Ordinals assets into Bioniq’s wallet, opting to wrap their assets for safekeeping while generating equivalent NFTs on the ICP network. This process enables trading on the ICP network, free from the usual gas or transaction fees and immune to the Bitcoin network’s speed limitations. Bioniq’s launch addresses the market capitalization growth of BRC-20 tokens and tackles the issue of Bitcoin network congestion. The platform’s unique approach offers a more reliable and efficient trading experience, even in high Bitcoin fee environments. Looking ahead, Bioniq plans to expand its offerings, including a launchpad for new collections, a crypto borrowing feature using Ordinals assets as collateral, and a platform for collection offers targeting specific projects. This holistic approach marks a significant step forward in the crypto marketplace, bringing efficiency and innovation to the forefront.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Mad Lads, a Solana-based NFT, reaches a new floor price of 123 SOL or over $7,100. In November, the collection’s value more than tripled, indicating rapid growth. Mad Lads outperformed other NFTs with over $1.39 million in 24-hour sales. The digital asset space is witnessing a remarkable surge in the value and popularity of Mad Lads, a Solana-based profile picture (PFP) NFT collection. Outperforming many leading NFT projects, Mad Lads has reached new heights in its floor price and sales volume. As noted by Solana Floor data, Mad Lads’ entry price has recently experienced a significant increase. The collection’s floor price now stands at 123 SOL, equating to over $7,100. This marks a substantial rise, with the price more than tripling in November alone. On November 13, Decrypt reported the collection’s floor value at nearly $4,500 worth of SOL, highlighting a robust growth trajectory. Regarding sales, Mad Lads is making waves in the secondary markets. Over the past 24 hours, sales have exceeded $1.39 million, according to CryptoSlam data. This volume surpasses other notable NFT projects, including the Fortune Founder’s Pass from Army of Fortune and the renowned Bored Ape Yacht Club on Ethereum. The latter registered approximately $881,000 in sales, while Solana’s Tensorians followed closely with about $810,000. Several elements contribute to the increasing demand and value of Mad Lads. The Solana token has seen significant appreciation, rising from around $21 to a current value of $58, even touching $65 recently. This price increase has impacted the broader Solana NFT market, with sales topping $62 million in November, a steep rise from October’s $28 million. Mad Lads distinguishes itself with unique attributes. Developed by startup Coral, the collection integrates with the Backpack app and its executable NFTs (xNFTs) standard, providing a range of experiences around tokenized assets. Coral’s upcoming crypto exchange, licensed in Dubai and led by former FTX general counsel Can Sun, has also added to the project’s appeal. Mad Lads NFT holders were given priority access to exchange signups and received PYTH tokens during the recent Pyth Network airdrop on Solana. These factors, combined with the project’s innovative approach and exclusive holder benefits, fuel the increasing demand for Mad Lads NFTs. Mad Lads’ success is not just a triumph for the project itself but also signifies a pivotal moment in the NFT sector, especially for Solana-based projects. Its performance against Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club, a long-time leader in the NFT market, suggests a shift in investor interest toward Solana’s ecosystem. This shift could lead to increased competition and innovation within the NFT space as projects strive to offer unique benefits and experiences to their communities. As the NFT market continues to evolve, the success of collections like Mad Lads will likely inspire new developments and trends within this dynamic and ever-changing industry.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK A Bored Ape Yacht Club member named Crumz narrowly escaped a sophisticated scam disguised as an interview opportunity with Forbes. The scammer impersonated Forbes editor Robert LaFanco and contacted Crumz directly by message. Red flags included a non-premium Zoom account and a request to use a separate screen recording bot. In a recent turn of events, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community has witnessed an alarming scam attempt. A member of this prestigious NFT group, known as Crumz, narrowly escaped a well-orchestrated scheme. The scam, posing as an opportunity for an interview with Forbes, targeted Crumz through a direct message from an impersonator of Robert LaFanco, a real Forbes editor. Crumz faced several red flags during the interview, including the interviewer’s non-premium Zoom account and a request to use a separate recorder bot for screen recording. Despite these signs, Crumz initially complied with the requests. The scammer asked Crumz to fetch a banana, supposedly to add a personal touch related to his BAYC NFT. However, Crumz later realized that this request was a ploy to distract him and gain control of his computer remotely. 🚨🚨SCAM ALERT!!🚨🚨 I just spent the last 2hours on Zoom with \u0027@Forbes\u0027 it was pretty sophisticated and well thought out because I\u0027m usually on high alert but luckily I wasn\u0027t caught. Here\u0027s what they did. 🧵1/8 — Crumz 🇮🇪 (@crumz10) November 26, 2023 Upon refusing to leave his computer, Crumz observed the scammers attempting to take over his screen. He acted quickly to prevent any potential theft of his valuable digital assets. This incident highlights the growing sophistication of scams within the NFT community. Similar scams have been reported, involving fake journalists luring NFT owners into compromising their security for a supposed media feature. This case serves as a warning to the NFT community, particularly high-value asset holders like BAYC members. The incident underscores the importance of vigilance and skepticism when dealing with unsolicited offers, especially those involving access to personal or digital assets. The BAYC community and broader NFT holders are now more aware of these tactics, thanks to the sharing of this experience by Crumz and others who have encountered similar situations. As the NFT market thrives, collectors must stay informed and cautious. This incident not only reflects the vulnerabilities within the digital asset space but also the resilience of its members in the face of evolving cyber threats.",

Bean transitions to a memecoin project within Ethereum’s Blast ecosystem. In a significant shift, Azuki DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization associated with the Azuki nonfungible token (NFT) series, has announced a rebranding to “Bean.” This change comes alongside the decision to drop a previously proposed lawsuit against the NFT collection’s founder, Zagabond. The legal action concerned a contentious $39 million NFT minting event in June, initially stirring up substantial debate within the community. Moreover, the rebranding marks a strategic pivot for the DAO. Bean will transition into a memecoin project as part of its new direction, integrating into the Ethereum layer-2 Blast ecosystem. This move will enhance the project’s presence and capabilities within the digital asset space. Developers have revealed that Bean has already garnered significant support, securing $10 million in funding from notable investors. This financial backing aims to accelerate the project’s growth and development within the Blast ecosystem. The proposed Bean memecoin will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens, indicating the project’s ambitions for widespread adoption and utility. Additionally, there have been updates regarding the token distribution plan. Initially, as outlined on the DAO’s website, the plan detailed a 40% allocation of tokens to the treasury, 50% to Azuki DAO members, and 10% to Zagabond, the Azuki NFT creator. It also stated that minting would be exclusively available to Azuki NFT holders, with a 24-hour window for action, after which any unclaimed tokens would be subject to burn. However, recent clarifications indicate changes in the distribution strategy. The follow-up statement from the developers specified that “50% of the $Bean [token] was allocated to the Azuki DAO community for the airdrop of Azuki series NFTs,” a process concluded four months ago. The statement also confirmed that “40% of $Bean [token] was allocated to the Bean Treasury, and 10% of $Bean was allocated to Zagabond.” Godspeed @cz_binance pic.twitter.com/jIaCj43sx8 — ZAGABOND.ETH (@ZAGABOND) November 21, 2023 This rebranding and strategic shift signify a new chapter for the former Azuki DAO, now Bean.

The game combines narrative-driven gameplay with Ethereum-based NFTs, marking a new direction for the company in blockchain technology. Symbiogenesis auctions are divided into three phases, starting with an exclusive event for early backers on Nov 27 and 28. Square Enix, the renowned developer behind the Final Fantasy series, has recently unveiled its latest venture into the world of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) by announcing auction dates for its upcoming blockchain game, Symbiogenesis. Set to revolutionize the gaming and digital collectible experience, Symbiogenesis introduces a unique blend of narrative-driven gameplay and Ethereum-based NFTs.

The first phase, slated for Nov 27 to 28, is an exclusive event targeting early backers, termed “stakeholders.” This phase will feature a selection of facet and mesh characters intricately designed to capture the essence of the Symbiogenesis universe. This exclusive access underscores the company’s appreciation for early investors’ support. Following this, the second auction phase, from Nov 30 to Dec 4, and the third phase, from Dec 2 to 3, will open doors to a broader audience. Eligibility for these phases was determined through an allowlist entry campaign, which Square Enix conducted from Nov 7 to 21. This campaign was an engaging blend of quizzes and a treasure hunt within a prototype of the game world, adding an interactive element to the qualification process. Top performers in the campaign, specifically the 50 highest scorers, along with 40 randomly chosen participants from the 51st to 300th rank, earned the privilege to acquire NFTs in the second phase.

It promises an immersive story-driven experience intertwined with the ownership and trade of unique NFTs. The scheduled launch date for this ambitious project is Dec 21, a day anticipated by gaming and crypto enthusiasts alike. Square Enix’s move into blockchain gaming reflects the company’s adaptability and innovative spirit in the ever-evolving digital entertainment landscape. With a legacy of over 173 million units sold in the Final Fantasy series alone, Square Enix’s foray into NFTs with Symbiogenesis is not just an expansion of their digital offerings but a testament to their commitment to staying at the forefront of gaming technology. As the gaming world eagerly awaits the arrival of Symbiogenesis, it stands as a beacon of the exciting possibilities that blockchain technology brings to interactive storytelling and digital ownership.",

Significantly, the collection became a “blue chip” project in the NFT boom, with prices peaking at an average of $92,000. However, the road could have been smoother. The broader crypto market downturn and community discontent saw a drop in the value of these NFTs. Consequently, the Cool Cats Group sought to diversify and expand its reach.

Significantly, Matr1x is focusing on a first-person shooter game, Matr1x Fire. This game draws aesthetic inspiration from Riot Games’ Valorant. It features similar maps, weapons, and character designs. Matr1x Fire emphasizes team play, where five-person teams compete. However, unlike Valorant, it eschews special powers for a skill-based approach. This approach aligns more with CS:GO’s gameplay style. Additionally, Matr1x aims to establish an esports presence for its game, which remains under development. The studio has introduced two NFT collections and is currently in the process of developing a third collection. This upcoming collection will provide opportunities for governance participation and a stake in the creator economy, along with featuring an upgradeable Battle Pass. However, there are concerns within the gaming community. Some gamers draw parallels between Matr1x Fire and NetEase’s Hyper Front. Riot Games previously sued NetEase over Hyper Front, alleging it copied Valorant. As a result, Hyper Front was shut down. Many fear a similar fate for Matr1x Fire. The game has already garnered labels like “Valorant Mobile” in early-access footage. Despite these concerns, Matr1x is forging ahead. The company is transparent in its distinction from Valorant. It emphasizes a different gaming experience, focusing on gunplay and tactics. This distinction is crucial for Matr1x Fire to avoid legal entanglements and carve its niche. The funding and development trajectory of Matr1x signals a potentially transformative period in mobile gaming. Hence, the industry is watching closely, anticipating the impact of Matr1x’s ambitious projects.",

CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency tracking website, recently announced the acquisition of Zash, an innovative NFT data infrastructure platform, in a strategic expansion of its data services. This move signifies CoinGecko’s continued confidence in the NFT market despite its recent downturn. CoinGecko plans to enhance its application programming interface (API) by incorporating Zash’s comprehensive NFT data by the second quarter 2024.

Hanwe’s wallet, hanwe.eth, initially received 22.85 million BLUR tokens valued at $7.3 million. The value of BLUR tokens surged, reaching $0.37 each, according to CoinGecko. Surprisingly, the Blur NFT marketplace has made headlines once again. Under the pseudonymous name Hanwe, one trader walked away with a staggering $8.4 million worth of airdropped BLUR tokens from Season 2. This windfall resulted from Hanwe’s active participation in various NFT-related activities, including bids, listings, and lending, throughout Season 2. Hanwe’s hanwe.eth wallet received a whopping 22.85 million BLUR tokens, a reward initially valued at around $7.3 million when claimed shortly after the conclusion of Blur’s Season 2. However, the token’s value has since surged, with Blur’s token price experiencing an 8% increase, reaching $0.37, according to CoinGecko. Interestingly, Hanwe used the Ethereum Name Service to assign a human-readable name to their wallet, underscoring the rising trend of personalized NFT ownership. Hanwe received the largest share of rewards for Season 2, making this trader’s journey an impressive success story within the NFT space. Blur, a marketplace gaining traction rapidly and even surpassed OpenSea in NFT trading volume, has announced its plans for Season 3. The forthcoming season is set to introduce a new Ethereum layer-2 network called Blast, backed by Paradigm, Standard Crypto, and other prominent investors. Blur’s Season 3 will be “powered” by Blast, promising an exciting future for the platform. To add to the anticipation, Blur’s community can look forward to a significant airdrop at the end of Season 3 in May 2024. Blur will allocate 50% of the season’s rewards to those who deposit BLUR tokens into the platform in a shift from previous reward structures. This change aims to encourage more participation and engagement within the Blur ecosystem. Blur’s Season 2 also saw some traders, like @ESK_NFT on Twitter, achieving remarkable results by turning a modest starting fund into substantial airdrops, exemplifying the platform’s potential for ambitious participants. I gotta hand it to @ESK_NFT — he used just 2-3 ETH to farm Season 2 and managed to turn it into an $83,100 drop. Huge W for someone who hustles like crazy. Created a Discord group sharing his secrets \u0026 tools in the process. — NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 21, 2023 However, not all experiences were equally positive, as evidenced by notable trader Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother, who expressed his disappointment with his Season 2 haul. Despite the ups and downs, Blur’s growth and innovations in the NFT space continue to captivate the crypto community, and all eyes are now on the upcoming Season 3, powered by the promising Blast network.",

This unique partnership marks a significant stride in blending traditional retail with the burgeoning world of digital assets. Situated on the bustling Chunxi Road in Chengdu, the heart of China’s Sichuan province, this pop-up store has transformed into a vibrant “ghost ski resort,” offering an immersive experience for visitors.

Michel and associates deceitfully marketed these NFTs, promising rewards and benefits to investors that were never fulfilled. This fraudulent scheme left investors with considerable losses, highlighting the risks in the unregulated NFT market. In a significant development in the digital art world, Aurelien Michel, a French national, has admitted to a major fraud involving the sale of Mutant Ape Planet NFTs. This collection, a derivative of the renowned Mutant Ape Yacht Club by Yuga Labs, became the center of a $3 million fraud scheme. Michel’s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud was entered in a New York federal court, as announced by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York on November 14. Michel and his associates were accused of deceitfully marketing these NFTs, promising investors rewards and benefits to spur demand. However, these promises were never fulfilled. Instead, the proceeds, amounting to millions of dollars, were diverted for personal use. This act, known as a “rug pull” in cryptocurrency, left investors facing significant losses. Nonfungible Token (NFT) Developer Pleads Guilty to an International Scheme to Defraud NFT Purchasers Aurelien Michel Conspired to Steal From Purchasers of “Mutant Ape Planet” NFTs Through False Promises and Misrepresentations@HSINewYork @IRSCI_NY https://t.co/K3CzIb8dQD — US Attorney EDNY (@EDNYnews) November 14, 2023 Special agent Thomas M. Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation in New York emphasized the gravity of Michel’s actions, noting the transformation of investors’ dreams into a “nightmare of deception and losses.” The case underscores the risks inherent in the largely unregulated NFT market, where the line between innovative investment and fraudulent schemes can often blur. Michel’s arrest in January 2023 marked a turning point in the case. Following his arrest, he admitted to the community via social media that the project was indeed a rug pull, a confession that came amidst growing toxicity within the community. Upon sentencing, Michel faces up to five years in prison. Moreover, he has agreed to pay $1.4 million in restitution. This case highlights the ongoing challenges in the NFT space, where the excitement and novelty of digital assets often collide with the harsh realities of unscrupulous practices. The Mutant Ape Planet collection, once a prominent offering on the NFT platform OpenSea, showcased 6,797 NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Initially, the group enjoyed substantial sales, with over 320 Ether in volume by February 2022. However, its value had significantly declined by April of the same year. By Michel’s arrest, the average price and total sales volume had plummeted to near zero, reflecting the collapse of trust and value in the wake of the fraud. Michel’s case is a cautionary tale in the rapidly evolving world of NFTs. It highlights the need for greater oversight and consumer protection in a market that continues to captivate and confound investors and enthusiasts alike.",

Backpack, a Solana-based NFT wallet app, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange in Dubai. Trek Labs, connected to Backpack and Coral, has secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s VARA. Solana’s Mad Lads NFT collection has reached a new zenith in market value, coinciding with significant developments at Backpack, a Solana-based NFT wallet application. Backpack’s latest endeavor involves launching a cryptocurrency exchange in Dubai, a move bolstered by the appointment of former FTX general counsel Can Sun as the leader of this new venture. Backpack’s association with the soaring Mad Lads NFTs is undeniable. These digital collectibles have witnessed a remarkable price surge, starting at 82.37 SOL (approximately $4,480) on secondary marketplaces. This figure represents a substantial increase from their previous high, especially notable given Solana’s 148% rise over the past month. Can Sun’s role be pivotal in developing Trek Labs, the Dubai-based startup connected to Backpack and its creator, Coral? Having recently testified in the fraud trial against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Sun brings a wealth of experience and insight. This move comes after Trek Labs secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), setting the stage for a regulated exchange in the United Arab Emirates. The ripple effect of these developments extends beyond just the realms of cryptocurrency and legal expertise. Coral co-founder and CEO Armani Ferrante, a minority shareholder in Trek Labs, and Claire Zhang, Sun’s former deputy at FTX and Ferrante’s spouse, add interconnectedness between these entities. Moreover, Trek Labs has unveiled plans to sell a 10% stake in the company, seeking a valuation surpassing $100 million. This ambitious target reflects the growing confidence and potential in the digital asset space, particularly in a region as dynamic as Dubai. The recent beta signups for the Backpack exchange, initially exclusive to Mad Lads NFT holders, have further fueled interest in these digital assets.

In October, there was a 32% increase in NFT trading volume compared to September, amounting to $405 million.

The NFT landscape, previously plagued by declining interest and dropping values, is witnessing a notable resurgence. Recent data reveals a significant uptick in trading volumes and prices, injecting optimism into the market. October marked a pivotal month in this revival, showcasing a 32% increase in NFT trading volume compared to September. This rise, quantified at $405 million, signals a shift in trader sentiment. Although these figures still lag behind the zenith of January 2022, which saw about $5 billion in trades, the increase is nonetheless a positive indicator.

CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Azuki NFTs have seen their floor prices – the minimum price for NFTs in these collections – surge dramatically. CryptoPunks’ floor price soared by 82%, reaching approximately $125,500. Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki NFTs weren’t far behind, with 67% and 107% increases, respectively. This rejuvenation is not solely attributable to the rising crypto prices, though they play a role. Bitcoin and Ethereum have risen by 38% and 33% in the last month. These increases contribute to the enhanced allure of NFTs as valuable digital assets. The trading activity is also gaining momentum. Popular collections like Bored Ape and CryptoPunks have experienced substantial hikes in their trading volumes, by 140% and 1755%, respectively. This upswing is not limited to these well-known names; even lesser-known collections are seeing renewed interest. However, the scenario isn’t uniformly rosy. Some projects are still struggling to regain their former glory. For instance, DraftKings NFT trading dipped by 40%, and trading on Ethereum’s scaling network, Polygon, saw a 58% decline. Despite these variances, the overall trend points to revitalizing the NFT market. This upturn starkly contrasts the previous year and a half, where both crypto and NFT markets were in a slump. The current boost in trading volumes and prices is breathing new life into the space, drawing in long-time traders and new participants. It’s important to note that we are still some distance from the frenzied heights of the initial NFT boom. Nevertheless, the market is showing tangible signs of recovery. This resurgence is a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets and their potential for rapid shifts in value and interest. As the landscape evolves, it presents opportunities and challenges for traders and investors in digital assets.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK China criminalizes the theft of digital collections, including NFTs. Digital collections are classified as both data and virtual property. Illegal access to computer systems is part of digital theft in China. China has recently announced a significant legal stance against the theft of digital collections, including nonfungible tokens (NFTs). According to a statement released on November 10, individuals involved in such activities will face theft charges. The Chinese government’s declaration clarifies the legal status of digital collections, categorizing them as data and virtual property, a perspective that aligns with the concept of “co-offending.” The government emphasizes that stealing a digital collection is not just a breach of ownership but also involves illegal access to computer systems. This dual violation, encompassing both property law and computer information system data protection, underlines the seriousness with which China views the theft of digital assets. This approach classifies digital collections, notably NFTs, as “network virtual property,” recognizing their intrinsic value in property law. Interestingly, NFTs, known for their unique and tamper-proof nature through blockchain technology, are highlighted in this context. Despite China’s stringent stance on crypto-related activities, this move acknowledges the growing significance of NFTs, which are increasingly seen as valuable assets due to their unique characteristics. Moreover, China’s approach to NFTs is evolving. While the country has yet to open a secondary market for digital collections, consumers can engage in transactions through trading platforms. These platforms facilitate various operations, including purchasing, collecting, transferring, and destroying digital assets, thereby granting consumers exclusive possession and control over these virtual properties. Additionally, recent developments indicate a growing interest in NFTs within China. Alibaba’s Xianyu, a peer-to-peer marketplace, recently lifted its censorship on search terms related to NFTs and digital assets. This move, reported on October 25, suggests a softening attitude towards the digital asset market. Further emphasizing this trend, China Daily, a government-owned English-language newspaper, announced plans on October 6 to create its own NFT platform. The newspaper intends to invest 2.813 million Chinese yuan (approximately $390,000) in this venture, indicating the government’s increasing engagement with digital assets.",

David Baszucki, CEO of the renowned virtual universe game Roblox, recently shared his vision for the future of digital collectibles and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In an interview with CNBC following Roblox’s Q3 2023 earnings call, Baszucki discussed how major influencers could significantly contribute to the widespread acceptance and adoption of NFTs and digital items. He emphasized the potential for these assets to move seamlessly across various digital platforms, enhancing their value and usability. Baszucki’s idea involves enabling users to transfer their digital collectibles from one platform to another. This concept could transform how digital assets are perceived and traded. He cited the example of high-profile celebrities like Elton John collaborating with Roblox to create exclusive digital items, such as capes, for charitable causes. Once sold on Roblox, these limited edition items could become NFTs and be traded on different marketplaces, thus transcending the boundaries of a single digital environment. The Roblox CEO’s remarks came when the company reported a 20% year-over-year increase in bookings, thanks to a surge in in-game spending and an expanding user base. Despite posting a loss in the third quarter, Roblox’s performance indicates a robust and growing interest in digital gaming and e-commerce. NFT volume for the past 5 weeks has been steadily increasing 📈 The bottom was the week closing 9th Oct, where NFT weekly volume was 29,704 ETH, compared to last week, week ending Nov 6th, NFT sales volume reached 68,342 ETH Slowly then suddenly…?https://t.co/SOlhKZezmO pic.twitter.com/420fiRYw9e — Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) November 6, 2023 Additionally, the NFT market has been experiencing a significant uptick. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen highlighted a notable rise in NFT sales volumes in November. Specifically, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection showcased the highest trading volume, amounting to 35,226 ETH, valued at $66.7 million. Concurrently, data from NFTGo revealed a 12% increase in NFT traders over the same period, signaling a growing interest in the NFT space. Baszucki’s vision aligns with these market trends, underscoring the potential for digital collectibles to become more than just assets confined to a single platform. His proposal hints at a future where digital items gain new life and value as they traverse different virtual spaces, propelled by the creativity and influence of their creators. This concept of inter-platform mobility for digital assets could redefine the dynamics of digital ownership and trading. It points towards a more interconnected and fluid digital economy, where the lines between different virtual platforms blur, allowing for a more integrated and expansive digital experience.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Artfi CEO Asif Kamal is initiating legal proceedings against Yuga Labs for eye injuries suffered at ApeFest Hong Kong. Several ApeFest attendees reported eye issues, allegedly due to improper lighting at the venue. Yuga Labs says they are investigating the situation and take it seriously. Speculation points to UV-C bulbs being used instead of blacklights. Art technology company Artfi’s CEO, Asif Kamal, has initiated legal proceedings against Yuga Labs, the maker of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs, after suffering from an eye infection and facial burns during ApeFest in Hong Kong. The decision to pursue legal action comes as reports surface of several ApeFest attendees experiencing eye injuries, purportedly due to inadequate lighting at the event’s venue. Kamal expressed his concerns, stating, “I don’t want the price of Apes, the BAYC community, Yuga Labs, or anyone who has supported this Web3 ecosystem to suffer, but neglecting it is something that has offended me so much.” Yuga Labs responded by indicating that they are still investigating and taking the situation seriously. Speculation on Twitter suggests that UV-C bulbs intended for disinfection might have been used instead of blacklights during the event. As Kamal recounted his distressing visit to Hong Kong’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he received treatment for his eye condition, he described sending a legal notice to Yuga Labs as the “first step toward suing them.” He spoke of feeling helpless during the ordeal and experiencing temporary blindness.

In an interview from Dubai, Kamal, now wearing sunglasses, revealed his ongoing vision troubles and discomfort in one eye. Before the incident, he owned a Mutant Ape NFT and purchased a $60,000 Bored Ape to support the BAYC community in front of co-founder Greg “Garga” Solano. Kamal shared that two other attendees he knows are facing similar symptoms, and he hopes Yuga Labs will prioritize safety measures for future events. He emphasized the importance of safeguarding the community’s well-being, contributing to Yuga Labs’ success. In this unfolding situation, legal action may shed light on the responsibilities of event organizers and creators in ensuring attendee safety at NFT gatherings like ApeFest.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://www.todaynftnews.com/investor-report-significant-90-downward-adjustment-in-stake-for-opensea-platform/",
    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Coatue Management has significantly reduced the valuation of its investment in OpenSea by 90%, from $120 million to $13 million. The markdown of OpenSea reflects a broader trend of declining valuations in the NFT and Web3 sectors. OpenSea has faced challenges due to the bear market and decreased NFT trading, leading to a substantial workforce reduction of 50%. Coatue Management, a prominent tech investment firm based in the United States, has made a significant move by marking down its investment in the nonfungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea. The company has reduced its initial investment of $120 million to a mere $13 million, reflecting a staggering 90% decrease in the value of its stake. This substantial markdown indicates that OpenSea’s on-paper valuation has plummeted to approximately $1.4 billion. This development comes on the heels of Coatue Management’s decision to also mark down its investment in MoonPay, a Web3 payment provider, by a similarly substantial 90%. These markdowns signal a shifting landscape within the NFT and Web3 sectors. In January 2022, OpenSea raised an impressive $300 million in a Series C funding round led by crypto venture capital firm Paradigm and Coatue Management. At that time, the NFT platform was riding high, with a valuation of $13.3 billion. However, the recent bear market and a prolonged decline in NFT trading activity have forced OpenSea to take drastic measures. On November 3, OpenSea announced a workforce reduction of 50% as part of its strategy to relaunch as “OpenSea 2.0.” CEO Devin Fizner stated that this streamlined team would make the platform more agile and responsive. OpenSea’s new version will focus on enhancing its technology, speed, and overall quality. 1/9 OpenSea is making some big changes today to focus on the next version of our product. — Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) November 3, 2023 It’s worth noting that OpenSea faced criticism earlier in the year when it retired its operator filter, a feature that allowed creators to blocklist non-royalty-enforcing marketplaces, sparking controversy within the NFT community. Coatue Management’s decision to mark its investment coincides with a broader slump in NFT trading volumes. After reaching its peak in 2021 with over $14 billion in sales, the NFT market has experienced an 80% drop in trading volumes since March 2022. However, a recent report from crypto data firm DappRadar suggests a glimmer of hope, with the NFT market recording its first month of gains in over a year, posting a $99 million increase month-over-month in October. Coatue Management’s substantial markdown of its investment in OpenSea highlights the challenges and adjustments faced by the NFT sector in a changing market landscape. As OpenSea strives to adapt and revamp its platform, the broader NFT industry continues to navigate the complexities of evolving trends and investor sentiment.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK NFT trading volume experienced a significant surge with a single-day high of $19.1 million. CryptoPunk sales contributed $3.6 million to the daily volume, with the transaction by Aronow being the most notable. A satirical “The Simpsons” segment on NFTs coincided with the market upswing and inspired related knockoff collections and sales. NFT trading surged to a notable high on Monday, marking a significant rebound with a daily volume of $19.1 million. This resurgence is partly credited to a hefty transaction involving a CryptoPunks NFT by Wylie “Gordon Goner” Aronow, Bored Ape Yacht Club co-founder. Aronow acquired CryptoPunk #7458 for a staggering 600 ETH, equivalent to $1.1 million. CryptoPunks sales alone brought in $3.6 million, with this seven-figure deal leading the charge. Moreover, the market witnessed this upswing alongside a ripple effect from a satirical segment on NFTs by “The Simpsons.” This episode, while poking fun at the NFT craze, seems to have indirectly spurred the creation and sale of related knockoff collections. Additionally, October had already set a positive precedent with a 32% rise in sales from the previous month. The current peak in trading volume surpasses any single day’s activity of that month, suggesting a sustained interest in the digital collectibles market. However, despite the recent spike, the market is yet to match the frenzied heights of April 2022, when weekly volumes hit $1.4 billion.

This shift may stem from Blur’s strategy of incentivizing traders with the prospect of BLUR token airdrops, which has attracted controversy and increased platform activity. Hence, while “The Simpsons” might have brought NFTs to a broader audience, the core trading community appears consistent, with few new entrants to the space. This aligns with Punk9059’s observations on the number of unique wallets involved in Ethereum-based NFT purchases, which only saw a significant increase after the show aired. While the NFT market has experienced a notable spike in trading volume, the long-term sustainability of this trend remains to be seen, with market dynamics constantly in flux.",

Rino Russo’s creation tops OpenSea trends, with all NFTs quickly sold out upon launch. Springfield Punks ranks just below Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks in daily volume on OpenSea. The NFT world has witnessed the rise of a new player, Springfield Punks. This collection, a fusion of “The Simpsons” motif with the distinctive look of CryptoPunks, achieved a staggering $2.5 million in sales within the first 24 hours of its launch, becoming a trending phenomenon on OpenSea. The brainchild of parody artist Rino Russo, Springfield Punks captured the attention of enthusiasts quickly, with all 3,405 Ethereum NFTs being claimed promptly after release. 🎃🎃🎃 Bart’s an NFT in Treehouse of Horror XXXIV 👻👻👻 Celebrate with free Springfield Punks mint live now!! 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️ Mint Site: https://t.co/E8DD0JhAY6 Contract: https://t.co/o5J43ndaKb #Simpsons #NFTs #Halloween #FreeMint pic.twitter.com/v1D9ccSj4X — Rino Russo (@RinaldoRu) November 6, 2023 Moreover, the Springfield Punks collection now commands a notable spot on the leaderboard for daily volume, trailing just behind industry titans Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks. This surge in activity underscores the collection’s swift ascension to prominence, a feat that aligns with the buoyant and often unpredictable nature of the NFT marketplace. Additionally, this upswing in interest aligns with a recent “The Simpsons” episode that poked fun at the NFT craze, offering an inadvertent nod to various existing NFT collections, including notable mentions of Beeple’s Everyday and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The animated series’ take on digital collectibles has only fueled the fire for NFT aficionados and collectors. Other collections drawing from the same well of inspiration, such as “SimpsPunks,” have vied for attention on OpenSea, further validating the immense draw of “The Simpsons” influence. “The Chimpsons Official” collection, although not new, having been established last September, also enjoyed a spike in visibility following the episode, with its floor price experiencing a significant overnight hike. The appeal of Springfield Punks is evident in the trading volume, with a reported 1,311 ETH worth of transactions, highlighting the market’s appetite for themed digital assets. As the collection finds its place in the market, the floor price reflects a healthy interest, with the lowest-priced NFTs commanding just under 0.11 ETH. Despite the unofficial status of Springfield Punks and the absence of an official “The Simpsons” NFT release to coincide with the show’s latest “Treehouse of Horror” installment, Disney has previously dabbled in the arena. In 2021, Disney released “The Simpsons” NFTs on the VeVe marketplace to mark the launch of Disney. The rapid rise of Springfield Punks offers a clear signal of the ongoing enthusiasm for NFTs that combine recognizable pop culture elements with the digital art form. As the collection continues to trade actively, it reflects the dynamic and ever-shifting landscape of digital collectibles. This event also showcases the powerful influence of mainstream media on the burgeoning NFT market, with “The Simpsons” catalyzing the latest trend. While the future of Springfield Punks in the volatile NFT market remains to be seen, its explosive entrance serves as a testament to the genre’s capacity for swift ascents to fame and fortune. With a community eagerly watching, Springfield Punks has etched its place in the digital realm, awaiting its next move in a space that thrives on innovation and nostalgia alike.",

Yuga Labs, creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, maintain silence post-resignation, with no further comment on the incident. Salihu’s controversial tweets disrupt Yuga Labs’ significant period of growth, including ApeFest and a new Ethereum NFT marketplace launch. Amidst a storm of social media controversy, Yuga Labs has confirmed the resignation of Shpend Salihu, their former Social Lead, after his past tweets of a racist and antisemitic nature resurfaced and sparked public outcry. Salihu, known by his handle NGBxShpend, was scrutinized as the objectionable content of his personal Twitter account went viral, leading to his departure from the company known for spearheading the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Salihu expressed regret over the situation via a tweet on Sunday, acknowledging that his previous statements had become a source of distraction and conflict. He asserted that his past tweets do not represent his beliefs or values. While confirming Salihu’s resignation, Yuga Labs opted not to comment further on the events. Attempts to reach Salihu for a statement have so far been unsuccessful. Hey everyone, tough day today. I am stepping down from my position at Yuga Labs.

Yuga Labs also announced its collaboration with Magic Eden on a new Ethereum NFT marketplace. Additionally, some attendees felt discomfort, potentially attributed to UV light overexposure at the venue. This upheaval comes at a critical juncture for Yuga Labs, a company that, since its inception in early 2021, has seen its projects like the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherside contribute significantly to its trading volume, elevating the firm’s stature in the NFT space. Moreover, the company’s previous acquisition of intellectual property from CryptoPunks and Meebits has solidified its market position. The departure of Salihu has incited reactions from the NFT community, with collectors and owners raising concerns about the vetting process for company representatives. The issue casts a new light on the importance of thorough background checks, especially in roles linked directly to public engagement and brand image. Furthermore, this isn’t the first time Yuga Labs has faced accusations related to insensitive imagery. They have consistently refuted such allegations, focusing on the diverse backgrounds of their co-founders and addressing the claims with legal action when necessary, as evidenced by their lawsuit against Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen. Yuga Labs has navigated through this storm with a quick response, ensuring the focus remains on their creative endeavors and community engagement. Salihu’s exit is a stark reminder of the impact of social media history on professional trajectories and corporate reputations in the digital age.",

The layoffs are part of a strategic move towards creating “OpenSea 2.0,” which aims to improve technology, reliability, and the user experience.

In a strategic shift towards agility, OpenSea has confirmed substantial staff reductions, cutting its workforce by 50%. This decisive action, revealed on Friday, marks a significant restructuring for the NFT marketplace, which previously enjoyed a leading position during the industry’s peak trading periods. OpenSea has taken this step to streamline operations, ensuring the platform can evolve at the pace demanded by the current NFT space. “Today, we are making significant organizational and operating changes as we focus on building a more nimble—and ultimately better—version of OpenSea,” a spokesperson shared. This move is seen as a preparation for “OpenSea 2.0,” a comprehensive upgrade touted to enhance the platform’s technology, reliability, and user experience.

OpenSea’s approach to the layoffs reflects an understanding of the current challenging climate, offering a buffer for those impacted. The NFT market, once buoyant, has felt the pinch of the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. OpenSea faced competitive pressures, especially from Blur, which recently took the lead in trading volume, although OpenSea still maintains a larger trader base. These developments follow a previous reduction in July 2022, when the company addressed economic uncertainties by downsizing by 20%. Despite the cutbacks, OpenSea had sustained a robust trading activity with over 32,000 unique wallets engaging on its platforms over the past week, even as it adjusts its course in response to market shifts. OpenSea’s commitment to maintaining its royalty policy amidst industry-wide changes has been a balancing act, reflecting its dedication to creators’ interests.

The sale demonstrates the increasing market value and collector interest in digital collectibles, particularly NFTs associated with popular sports figures. The platform’s growth is evident, with $713 million in NFT sales and a substantial valuation increase following a $680 million Series B funding round in 2021. In a striking display of the digital collectibles market’s vitality, an NFT of NBA rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama eclipsed the sale figures for his physical trading cards. The digital asset, crafted by Sorare NBA and tied to the San Antonio Spurs’ number one draft pick, changed hands for a formidable 61.182 ETH, translating to approximately $110,120. This transaction outpaced the previous record for a Wembanyama trading card by a significant margin, with the physical version selling for $67,333 earlier in August. Sorare NBA’s unique offering merges the realm of sports fandom with the burgeoning technology of NFTs, allowing enthusiasts to possess and utilize these digital assets within their fantasy sports engagements. The purchase underscores Wembanyama’s rapidly growing stature within the basketball community and accentuates the shifting paradigms of collectibility in the digital age. Moreover, selling Wembanyama’s NFT relieves Sorare’s platform’s escalating trajectory. Since its inception in 2019, Sorare has introduced an innovative fantasy soccer game and expanded its purview to include partnerships with the NBA and Major League Baseball. Such alliances have borne fruit, with Sorare’s ventures yielding over $713 million in NFT sales.

A digital token of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks’ marquee player, fetched a handsome 113.9 ETH, or about $187,000 at the time, setting a precedent in February. The burgeoning interest in NFTs, particularly those merging real-world talents with digital ownership, highlights a nuanced shift in collectible culture. These assets promise more than mere possession; they offer utility in virtual games, rewards, and an immutable record of ownership. Sorare’s strategic maneuvers within this niche appear increasingly astute, with the digital sports collectible market gaining momentum. Concluding the discourse on this digital sports memorabilia milestone, the Wembanyama NFT’s notable auction results cement the convergence of sports, technology, and investment, marking another chapter in the evolution of sports fandom and digital collectibles.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Elon Musk raised concerns on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast about the potential loss of NFT-linked artwork. Some Ethereum-based platforms, like Art Blocks, store artwork directly on the blockchain, which can be recreated anytime. Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol ensures the complete on-chain storage of assets, permanently linking them to the blockchain via a single satoshi. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and owner of Twitter, recently commented on the potential vulnerabilities surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) during his appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Musk highlighted the issue and stated that many NFTs link to artwork on external servers. Consequently, he suggested that owners might lose their related artwork if such hosting companies go out of business. Podcast with the great and powerful @elonmusk #ad Full episode is 2 hours and 41 minutes, first 2 hours is available here on https://t.co/AIkGSaxVMA pic.twitter.com/DQh0GGNyaO — Joe Rogan (@joerogan) October 31, 2023 However, not all NFTs face this issue. Projects on Ethereum, the leading blockchain network for NFTs, sometimes store their artwork directly on-chain. Notably, platforms like Art Blocks ensure their artists’ algorithms are on-chain. Hence, the art produced can be recreated from the output. Additionally, NFTs don’t always represent digital art. They can act as proof of ownership for items ranging from digital creations to tangible objects, like wristwatches. Significantly, there’s one NFT-style ecosystem that guarantees whole on-chain artwork storage: Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol. Through this, users can inscribe media or artwork directly onto the blockchain, linking it to a single satoshi, the smallest Bitcoin unit. This ensures the permanent recording of assets on the blockchain. As long as the Bitcoin network remains active, these assets endure. Bitcoin enthusiasts and supporters of the Ordinals swiftly reacted to Musk’s comments. Will Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, pointed out that around 38 million inscriptions are currently on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rohun “Frank” Vora, a prominent figure in the NFT space, emphasized how the Ordinals model addresses NFT criticisms. Moreover, Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus supported Musk’s stance, highlighting his preference for Ordinals over conventional NFTs. In a move that captured the essence of Musk’s message, Leonidas, a prominent supporter of Ordinals, has inscribed the Musk video segment onto Bitcoin. His action emphasized the capability and resilience of the fully on-chain Ordinals, further endorsing its merits. While Musk’s comments have sparked debate, they’ve also brought attention to the continuous innovations in blockchain and NFTs. Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol is a potential solution to some concerns raised about off-chain storage of NFT-linked media.",

Now, transforming cherished personal experiences into digital assets is a swift process, bypassing the once-necessary intricate grasp of blockchain technology. Moreover, this innovation has its challenges. The ease of minting might lead to an influx of NFTs on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, leading to potential concerns about blockchain expansion. Sustainability, especially from an environmental standpoint, is now under the spotlight. The sentimental attachment to these new NFTs also introduces a novel dimension to their value. As personal experiences become tradable commodities, the distinction between emotional and market value might become hazier. This nuance could lead to some misconceptions about the actual worth of such assets. Don’t just collect NFTs… CREATE them. With Camera Mint on Phantom mobile, instantly turn photos and videos into @solana NFTs you can save forever. pic.twitter.com/4Ei0LpdKUI — Phantom (@phantom) October 30, 2023 Significantly, the erratic tendencies of the NFT market can lead to rapid value shifts. Such fluctuations might surprise those new to this realm, especially if they need to be privy to the market dynamics. However, Phantom has yet to focus on minting merely. Their platform’s reward system is structured to boost user interactions with Camera Mint. While such a tactic might increase user engagement, a potential pitfall is the inadvertent promotion of quantity over quality. Hence, Phantom is on the clock to ensure its platform remains a hub for content of unerring quality. Furthermore, the user experience is enriched with features like an integrated display for minted NFTs under the ‘collectibles’ tab. But there’s room for improvement. Offering in-depth information about NFTs, blockchain intricacies, and potential digital asset risks can pave the way for a well-informed user community. Phantom’s Camera Mint feature is a noteworthy addition to the NFT space, making the creation process more accessible. However, with opportunities come challenges that the company must address to ensure long-term success and user satisfaction. Only time will reveal the real impact of this feature in the rapidly advancing digital collectible landscape.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Avante Art has partnered with Yuga Labs to offer tangible prints of CryptoPunk NFTs for a limited 48-hour window. The “Punk-On-Chain” version requires CryptoPunk NFT owners to prove ownership before commissioning a physical print. Both print editions include a Yuga Labs holographic sticker as a mark of authenticity. Avante Art has teamed up with Yuga Labs, the owner of the CryptoPunks brand, to offer a limited-time opportunity for CryptoPunk NFT holders. Beginning October 26 at 3:00 p.m. UTC and running for a mere 48 hours, the online art store allows enthusiasts to obtain tangible prints of their digital art. Hence, two distinctive versions of these iconic pieces are on the menu at Avante Art. The first, named “Punk-On-Chain,” allows each CryptoPunk NFT owner to commission a physical print. However, proving ownership is essential before one can request a print. This strategic move ensures exclusivity, as those without the on-chain version can’t acquire its physical counterpart. Our print collaboration with @avant_arte is officially live – for 48 hours only. Punk On-Chain is available exclusively to CryptoPunk holders at https://t.co/skT1FKTJgB pic.twitter.com/X657IqdgUT — CryptoPunks (@cryptopunksnfts) October 26, 2023 Additionally, Avante Art is presenting the “10,000 On-Chain” collection. This set comprises prints of all 10,000 CryptoPunks and is available to all, regardless of ownership status. It’s worth noting the tangible differences between these collections. The 10,000 On-Chain artworks are crafted as Archival pigment prints with a silkscreen varnish seal. Conversely, the Punks-On-Chain prints utilize UV pigment techniques with white underpins. Both editions, however, come adorned with a Yuga Labs holographic sticker, affirming their authenticity. Moreover, the Punks-On-Chain prints have a unique feature: a QR code on the back. This code is a gateway to a digital Certificate of Authenticity (CoA) on the blockchain. The 10,000 On-Chain pieces, on the other hand, include a physical CoA. This document houses a QR code, which, unlike the former, is not on the print but leads to the digital certificate. Significantly, the genesis of CryptoPunks can be traced back to June 2017, courtesy of Larva Labs. These algorithmically generated art pieces, initially free for Ethereum network users to mint, have seen exponential appreciation. Currently, the starting price for a single CryptoPunk is around $78,000. The entire collection’s market cap stands impressively over $782 million, as per Coingecko data. It’s also noteworthy that Yuga Labs acquired CryptoPunks copyrights from Larva Labs in March 2022. Avante Art’s collaboration with Yuga Labs bridges the digital and physical realms, offering a fresh perspective on the rapidly evolving NFT market. This limited-time event celebrates the nostalgic beginnings of CryptoPunks and their undeniable present-day value.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK California’s U.S. District Judge ruled favor of Yuga Labs, ordering Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen to pay $1.5 million for trademark infringement. The judge imposed penalties beyond monetary damages, requiring Ripps and Cahen to stop all NFT sales and hand over their online blockchain assets. The court rejected the defendants’ counterclaim, affirming Yuga Labs’ rights to the Bored Ape Yacht Club marks. In a significant turn, California’s U.S. District Judge ruled in favour of Yuga Labs, the mastermind behind the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club. The judge ordered Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen to pay $1.5 million for infringing on Yuga Labs’ trademark rights. The profits Ripps and Cahen made from their counterfeit “Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club” led to this judgment. Besides the monetary damages, the judge imposed an additional penalty. The duo must stop all NFT sales and hand over their online blockchain assets. The court’s decision also emphasized the illegitimacy of Ripps and Cahen’s argument. They previously claimed their version was merely “satire” and “parody” of the original Bored Ape Yacht Club rather than a direct infringement. Moreover, the judge has granted Yuga Labs $200,000 in damages concerning cybersquatting violations. Cybersquatting involves registering a renowned brand or company’s domain name to sell it later for a profit. In this case, the domains rrbayc.com and apemarket.com were the culprits. The court observed, “Defendants only had an interest in the domain name to divert potential customers of Yuga Labs to their commercial website.” However, the court didn’t stop there; they rejected the defendants’ counterclaim, which accused Yuga Labs of using offensive imagery in their Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. The court highlighted that Yuga Labs, despite having unregistered BAYC Marks, still possessed the rights to those marks. Consequently, these marks are valid and protectable. The timing of domain registrations by Ripps and Cahen was another point of contention. The pair registered their domains post the launch of Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, further cementing the infringement case against them. The Bored Ape Yacht Club started in April 2021 and is a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Holders of these NFTs not only join an exclusive community and gain unlimited copyright for media or design usage. Such is the craze that Seth Green, the renowned Family Guy star, spent a hefty $300,000 to reclaim his Bored Ape NFT after a phishing incident.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Maison Margiela has launched a unique blockchain-based game, Numbers. The game is inspired by Margiela’s iconic 0-23 numbering system for its collections. By using ERC-1155 tokens on the Polygon network, the game ensures fairness and inclusivity. Maison Margiela, the renowned Parisian fashion house, has ventured into the Web3 space, launching a captivating blockchain-based game termed “Numbers.” Drawing inspiration from its iconic 0-23 numbering system, which represents its 23 distinct collections, this Web3 experience is reminiscent of “blockchain bingo.” Players will compete over the next few weeks to mint all 24 token-linked digits. The reward? A coveted spot in Maison Margiela’s evolving Web3 community. Significantly, as the numbers increase, their rarity does too. For instance, while a whopping 15,000 zeros are available, there are only 742 of the number 23s. A circle highlights the number currently up for grabs, while those fully minted appear in black. The game reaches its climax when the first 100 players have minted all 24 numbers or at Maison Margiela’s discretion. Besides the game’s intriguing concept, its fairness makes it stand out. These ERC-1155 tokens, minted on the Polygon network, are unique in that they’re soul-bound. Consequently, they are non-transferable, and each wallet can only mint one of each number. Additionally, minting comes at no gas fee to ensure a level playing field, and every user receives the same gas allocation for each transaction. Hence, while early birds might have a slight advantage, the game fundamentally rewards perseverance and strategic insight. Moreover, Margiela’s foray into gamified minting is timely and astute. While the NFT market has seen a recent dip, the gaming industry continues its robust growth. According to IPSOS, gaming, currently valued at $385 billion, is projected to soar to over $522 billion by 2027. The symbolism isn’t lost on those familiar with Maison Margiela’s heritage. Every physical item from the fashion house comes with a tag numbered 0-23. The circled number corresponds to the collection to which the piece belongs. Furthermore, Martin Margiela’s preference for collective statements over personal appearances in the brand’s early days resonates with the decentralized ethos of Web3. This isn’t the brand’s first brush with technology, either. Earlier this year, they incorporated on-chain certificates of authenticity, accessible via NFC chips, in their signature Tabi footwear. In conclusion, Maison Margiela’s innovative blend of fashion and technology signifies a promising fusion of the past and the future, bridging the gap between traditional luxury and the digital frontier.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK The High Court of Singapore approved using NFTs by iSanctuary to mark wallets linked to a high-profile hack as a means of digital asset recovery. These NFTs contain a worldwide freeze order issued by the court and are a constant reminder to parties involved in transactions with the marked wallets. The NFTs are designed to help track any funds that depart from these wallets, enhancing their effectiveness in asset recovery. In a unique approach to digital asset recovery, the High Court of Singapore recently approved a move by UK financial investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary (iSanctuary). The court allowed Sanctuary to use nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to mark wallets linked to a high-profile hack. Significantly, these are not your everyday NFTs; these digital tokens house a worldwide freeze order issued by the court. While these NFTs don’t impede transactions, they act as a constant reminder to all parties involved. Exchanges and potential trading partners will be notified of the wallets’ questionable history. Moreover, this creative use of technology doesn’t stop at the warning. The NFTs, produced by Singapore’s Mintable studio, are designed to aid in tracking any funds that depart from these wallets. However, these measures didn’t come out of the blue. iSanctuary was roped in by an entrepreneur who faced the misfortune of losing $3 million in cryptocurrency assets. With the melding of on-chain and off-chain evidence, iSanctuary was able to pin down the stolen funds. Presented before the Singapore High Court, their findings were instrumental in securing the unprecedented injunction. Besides the core details, iSanctuary has maintained discretion regarding the facts of the case. Still, it’s evident that Mintology, an application by Mintable, played a role in crafting these unique NFTs. Additionally, Zach Burks, the founder of Mintable, gave an indirect nod to their involvement in a recent post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Thanks @straits_times for the great article. Happy to help clean up the crypto space and move the NFT ecosystem into a realm of utility and away from the speculation of jpegs!

Singapore-based crypto exchanges have been implicated in laundering the stolen money, with fraudulent actors alleged to be Singaporeans. Furthermore, the scope of this incident is vast, involving nations from Singapore to Spain, Ireland, Britain, and various European countries. This landmark decision by the Singapore High Court marks a shift in how legal jurisdictions may approach the intricacies of digital assets.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK The French National Assembly approved the “Sorare Law” under the Digital Space Regulation Law. The decision received a majority vote, with 437 members in favor, but faced opposition from 77 members. Karima Lachgar, CEO of Olky Wallet, recognizes the law’s potential to bring credibility to the crypto gaming sector. The French National Assembly endorsed the “Sorare Law” as part of the broader Digital Space Regulation Law (SREN). The landmark decision, which witnessed a favorable vote from 437 of the 561 members, introduces a pioneering regulatory landscape for video games utilizing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and crypto-monetization avenues. The decision, however, hasn’t resonated well with everyone, as 77 members opposed its adoption. The legislation, coined as the “Jonum regime” for games with monetizable digital objects, delicately balances the scales between stimulating French startup innovation and fortifying user safety. With this enactment, a clear legal distinction is drawn for Jonum, distinguishing it from conventional video games and gambling. Karima Lachgar, the CEO of Olky Wallet, noted the potential of SREN to lend credibility to a rapidly evolving sector, which has, in the past, been marred by scams. But the journey isn’t over. The legislation awaits scrutiny from the Constitutional Council, which possesses the power to either endorse or dismiss it. This is a turn of events some assembly members eagerly anticipate. Interestingly, critics argue the law may inadvertently favor crypto games over online casinos. Karima Lachgar, reflecting on the implications, hinted at the likelihood of betting platforms transitioning to the play-to-earn and Web3 domain, much like the state-run Pari Mutuel Urbain. The latter has already made inroads into the crypto realm with its fantasy horse racing game, Stables. Historically, French regulators believed that assets in crypto games fulfilled most criteria defining gambling. This put popular games, like Sorare and Stables, in jeopardy of being categorized as gambling ventures. Such classification brings with it hefty tax implications. Under the new law, however, the onus of ensuring compliance falls on the Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ), the French National Gambling authority. Consequently, crypto game platforms will mandate age declaration during account creation and ascertain player identity upon in-game earnings withdrawals. Notably, initial registration won’t demand identity verification. Moreover, the Jonum regime offers clarity on promotional strategies involving Web3 games and influencers. The directive explicitly bans the engagement of influencers for campaigns on platforms accessible to minors. This implies that popular platforms like YouTube might still be in the clear for promotional activities.",

These fees are directed towards the original creators. However, the changing market dynamics have threatened the consistent application of these royalties. A few NFT marketplaces began removing these fees in an effort to attract more users. Consequently, the successful implementation of this tactic caused significant shifts in platform dominance within the NFT marketplace. Additionally, OMA3 participants view this change as a risk, not only to the NFT space but to the ultimate goal of metaverse development. They believe in a metaverse where users have true digital ownership, enabling virtual items to move effortlessly between platforms. Robby Yung, the CEO of Animoca Brands and co-founder of OMA3, emphasized the significance of creator royalties. He believes that without the promise of future royalty benefits, creators might be hesitant to share their content. His vision is for a more democratic, transparent, and fair online ecosystem than what currently exists. However, Yung acknowledges a challenge. Many current NFT purchasers seem to be more focused on immediate financial gains rather than considering the broader implications for the digital community. The OMA3 working group, featuring Animoca, Yuga Labs, Magic Eden, and others like Decentraland, aims to establish protective measures for these royalties. They hope to introduce universal standards for NFT marketplaces, ensuring these fees are upheld. Mike Seavers, the CTO of Yuga Labs, expressed Yuga’s commitment to a fair and interoperable Web3 environment. They’re dedicated to working alongside OMA3 in setting the standards for success. Moreover, some renowned NFT brands, in response to platforms like OpenSea halting creator royalty enforcement, have considered limiting their association. Yuga Labs, for example, considered ending its NFT brand compatibility with OpenSea after it ceased enforcement of royalties. To conclude, the digital landscape is evolving, and the need to protect creator royalties is more pressing than ever. OMA3’s initiative, backed by industry heavyweights, aims to restore balance and ensure fairness within the NFT marketplace.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cohen (also known as “Pauly”) face legal challenges. The defense’s arguments were not persuasive to the Ninth District U.S. Court of Appeals judges during the October 17 hearing. Sprankling positioned Ripps and Cahen’s NFT sales as avant-garde art aiming to push the boundaries of free speech. Ryder Ripps, a prominent NFT artist, and Jeremy Cohen, identified as “Pauly” in certain circles, faced an uphill battle in a recent courtroom showdown. The duo’s defense, led by esteemed attorney Thomas Sprankling of the WilmerHale firm, seemed unable to sway the Ninth District U.S. Court of Appeals judges in an October 17 hearing. Moreover, the crux of the defense revolved around the controversial Bored Ape NFTs. Sprinkling asserted that these NFTs, supposedly imitating the original Yuga Labs collection, served as a protest against hidden anti-Semitic imagery. By positioning Ripps and Cahen’s sales as avant-garde, the attorney emphasized the boundaries of speech they intended to push. Additionally, Sprinkling referred to the anti-SLAPP statute in California, which aims to halt lawsuits that intimidate and suppress free speech. He told the panel that the statute is a safeguard, ensuring no speech-chilling threats arise from legal proceedings. Furthermore, the defense motion under anti-SLAPP highlighted their belief that Yuga Labs initiated the lawsuit merely to stifle their protest art and inundate them with exorbitant legal fees. However, the judges focused on the NFT sales rather than the proclaimed artistic intent. In a poignant moment, Judge Anthony Johnstone remarked, “He was selling the same images, on the same marketplaces, on virtually indistinguishable NFT identifiers.” Echoing a similar sentiment, Judge Morgan Christen voiced her confusion, indicating that the defense’s argument failed to resonate with the bench. In conclusion, while the artist’s intentions might be rooted in pushing the boundaries of expression, the court’s focus seems firmly on sales and potential infringement. As the case progresses, how this interpretation shapes the final judgment remains to be seen.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK UK’s CMS Committee highlights NFTs’ impact on intellectual property rights. Government urged to collaborate with NFT marketplaces to combat copyright violations. Misattribution of artwork is a concern, potentially harming artists’ future earnings, and necessitating rules for NFT platforms. The UK’s Culture, Media and Sports (CMS) Committee, composed of distinguished MPs, has released a pivotal report shedding light on the interplay between Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and intellectual property rights. Significantly, they’ve called upon the government to align with NFT marketplaces in combating copyright infringements. Initiating their inquiry in November 2022, the committee delved deeply into the blockchain and NFT world. NFTs, especially those showcasing art, have been identified as potential pitfalls, inadvertently infringing on the intellectual rights of artists. Moreover, the committee found that these violations often occur on platforms with little to no avenues for redress. Caroline Dinenage, Conservative MP and Chair of the CMS Committee, remarked on the severity of the issue. She emphasized that artists are increasingly vulnerable, with their creations being appropriated and promoted without consent. Additionally, the convoluted advertising realm only adds layers of complexity, posing risks for both artists and investors. However, the challenges don’t end with mere copyright. The report also spotlighted the precarious situation artists face when their creations are misattributed. Such misrepresentations can jeopardize an artist’s future earning potential. Consequently, the committee believes that clear rules need to be set for online platforms, including NFT marketplaces, to protect everyone involved from fraudulent or illegal content. Another intriguing aspect the committee touched upon is the intersection of NFTs and sports. Fan tokens have emerged as tools to enhance fan engagement with their favorite teams. Buyers of these tokens receive perks, rewards, and exclusive interactions. Yet, the committee remains skeptical. They believe that the volatile nature of these tokens makes them an unreliable metric of genuine fan engagement. Additionally, the report warned that these speculative ventures could harm both the fans financially and the clubs’ reputation. Moreover, deceptive NFT advertising is on the committee’s radar. They advocate for a robust regulatory framework to oversee the advertising process, ensuring that consumers are shielded from potential harm. It’s worth noting that current UK regulations compel crypto firms to ensure their ads are clear, and fair, and carry prominent risk disclaimers.",

The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City has recently added a captivating piece to its permanent collection: “Unsupervised—Machine Hallucinations” by renowned Turkish digital artist Refik Anadol. Ingeniously crafted by Anadol, this generative artwork utilizes artificial intelligence to reinterpret and recreate visuals based on over two centuries of art from the museum’s archives. Consequently, every glance at the piece reveals an ever-changing tapestry of audiovisuals influenced by the museum’s vast art catalog. However, the unpredictability of “Unsupervised” doesn’t stop there. External factors like light variations, acoustics, movement, and even atmospheric conditions continually shape its appearance and auditory experience. This dynamic creation has drawn numerous visitors to the MoMA lobby, which will remain on display until October 29. Despite the admiration from many, the artwork has sparked debates. Significantly, discussions have arisen about the role of AI in art creation and how museums should categorize such contemporary pieces. Noted art critic Jerry Saltz has described Anadol’s masterpiece as a “glorified lava lamp,” emphasizing the polarized reactions the piece has garnered. Moreover, Anadol, in a recent tweet, highlighted that “Unsupervised” stands as the “first generative AI and tokenized artwork” to grace MoMA’s collection. Besides its AI accolades, “Unsupervised” has stepped into the realm of digital assets. Anadol has minted an accompanying Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection for the piece.

China Daily, the English-language publication affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, has unveiled its ambition to dive into the burgeoning world of the metaverse and NFTs. Significantly, the newspaper has set aside a generous budget of 2.813 million Chinese yuan ($390,000) to find a third-party contractor. This contractor, be it Chinese or foreign, must be proficient in the domain of blockchain.

They have until October 17 to submit their applications and a mere three months thereafter to materialize their proposed design. The overarching goal for this venture is noble China Daily aims to amplify the global influence of Chinese civilization. To achieve this, the platform will harness a medley of advanced technologies. Besides blockchain and NFTs, the platform will leverage the metaverse, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, big data, and cloud computing. All these technologies combined aim to provide users with an immersive experience that resonates with the essence of Chinese civilization. Additionally, developers have outlined some critical specifications for the platform. It must be versatile enough to handle the uploading, showcasing, and management of a myriad of digital collections. This includes supporting different multimedia forms and a variety of collection types. Moreover, the platform should be equipped with functions for pricing, bidding, and running limited-time events. The integration of multi-currency settlement is yet another essential feature. However, China Daily doesn’t intend to restrict its NFT collections to its own platform. In its quest for a wider reach, the newspaper plans to collaborate with some of the most renowned international NFT platforms. OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, and Foundation are among the potential candidates for this collaboration. Consequently, this move is particularly intriguing given China’s stance on cryptocurrencies. Since 2021, all forms of cryptocurrency transactions have been outlawed in the country.

The scam involved the project’s deployer account activating the “withdrawToken” function. LSC primarily targeted the Chinese crypto market and had significant promotional activities on popular platforms like Toutiao and Zhihu. In a recent development, Lucky Star Currency (LSC), an astrology-themed nonfungible token (NFT) initiative, has reportedly executed an exit scam, siphoning over $1 million. This revelation comes from a detailed report by blockchain security firm CertiK. LSC, which claims its foundation by astrologists, primarily targeted the Chinese crypto investment market. The project’s unique selling point revolved around its NFTs, with its contracts encompassing an Award Center and an NFT Marketplace. However, the project’s credibility hit when its deployer account activated the “withdrawToken” function. This action drained over $1 million in LSC from the NFTMerge and AdwardCenter contracts. The extracted tokens were subsequently exchanged for the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin and transferred to a separate account. #CertiKSkynetAlert 🚨 We can confirm an exit scam on @AstrAstrol75591 LSC token Bsc: 0x2b3559c3DBdB294cbb71f2B30a693F4C6be6132d EOA 0x9Ef withdrew LSC tokens from the AwardCenter contract.

However, as of October 9, attempts to access the project’s website and user interface have been futile, with both platforms going offline. Delving deeper into the transactions, at approximately 02:52 a.m. UTC, a BNB Smart Chain address removed a staggering 1.6 million LSC from the AwardCenter contract. A subsequent transaction drained an additional 1.4 million LSC from the NFTMerge contract. These funds were swiftly converted into over $1 million in BUSD via PancakeSwap. The converted amount was then sent to an account that has, interestingly, been on the receiving end of BUSD from various sources for the past 82 days. This pattern suggests the possibility of multiple scams funneling money into this account. CertiK’s analysis further confirms that the contracts in question were indeed listed on Telegram as the project’s official contracts. Additionally, blockchain data indicates that the account responsible for the withdrawal is the deployer for the AwardCenter contract. Exit scams, especially from Chinese projects, have unfortunately become a recurring issue in the Web3 domain. The legal landscape in China, which deems running a centralized cryptocurrency exchange illegal, further complicates matters. Consequently, users who invest in Chinese protocols with centralized components might risk their funds being seized by authorities. In a similar incident in July, the China-based Multichain protocol witnessed a massive over $100 million drain into an attacker’s account. While the team has reported the arrest of their CEO, the victims remain in the dark, seeking clarity on the whereabouts of their investments.",

The typical price for CrypToadz NFTs on OpenSea is around 0.53 ETH, making this transaction highly unusual. Investigations revealed potential wash trading, as the buyer’s wallet had received a large sum from another wallet linked to Tornado Cash. The NFT market, a recent acquisition of CrypToadz #4030 on the OpenSea platform, has raised eyebrows and ignited intense speculation. The eye-catching transaction saw the NFT changing hands for a staggering $1.6 million, equivalent to 1,055 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) and an additional fee of nearly $42,000 worth of ETH. This acquisition has left many in the crypto community puzzled, given the current dip in NFT demand. Typically, CrypToadz NFTs start at a modest 0.53 ETH, approximately $835, on OpenSea, with the highest listed offer for this specific NFT hovering around 0.6 ETH, roughly $940. The significant premium paid for this profile picture (PFP) project has spurred initial reactions on Crypto Twitter, with some speculating the possibility of a “fat finger” mistake. In this scenario, the buyer unintentionally overspent in a hurried transaction. Oh geez this doesn’t look good. A Cryptoadz NFT sells for $1,660,000 (1,055 ETH). There were $41,500 in fees paid to OpenSea which makes me think it was a fat-finger error.

The wallet responsible for the CrypToadz NFT purchase had recently received approximately 1,116 ETH (approximately $1.76 million) from another wallet. Notably, in September, this second wallet received around 1,200 ETH (almost $1.9 million) from Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service. Tornado Cash functions as an automated service designed to obscure the flow of cryptocurrency between wallets by blending funds from various users into a common pool. This process disrupts cryptocurrency’s transparent, on-chain movement, making it challenging to trace ETH’s movement. While privacy advocates argue that Tornado Cash offers a level of cryptocurrency transaction privacy, authorities view such tools as potential facilitators of money laundering. Consequently, Tornado Cash was banned in the United States following Treasury Department sanctions in 2022. The use of Tornado Cash to funnel a substantial amount of ETH into the wallet responsible for the CrypToadz NFT purchase raises questions about potential wash trading or money laundering activities. The NFT acquisition was likely utilized to complicate further the flow of funds across cryptocurrency wallets and assets. However, it’s important to emphasize that using Tornado Cash does not inherently imply illicit activity or intent.",

We are very excited to be working with the @avax team on this! https://t.co/JkBn1vaXpX — Blockticity (@blockticity) October 5, 2023 Moreover, blockchain technology, particularly Avalanche’s platform, plays a pivotal role in this endeavor. While traditional methods like QR codes and visuals have been employed to authenticate and track approved medical supplements, Blockticity’s solution anchors COAs to Avalanche, providing consistent, verifiable proof. Since blockchain records are immutable, it significantly reduces the potential for fraudulent tampering with the certification. Additionally, these NFTs are connected to a QR code on the physical product and involve meticulous third-party testing. This strategy enhances confidence among medical patients, ensuring they receive ACS Laboratory’s premium products, which are now backed by verifiable, blockchain-anchored data. In the initial issuance of COA NFTs, ACS Laboratory and Blockticity have minted 37,000 tokens. These are securely housed on Avalanche’s C-Chain as non-fungible tokens and are effortlessly traceable via the associated QR code.

However, the crypto industry has seen its fair share of turbulence recently. Notably, Chia Network and Utopia Labs, both major players in the crypto realm, have also announced workforce reductions this week. Daniel Alegre, the CEO of Yuga Labs, shared insights into the company’s decision. He emphasized that since joining the company six months ago, his primary focus has been on honing the company’s vision. This vision centers on creative storytelling and robust community building, the very essence of Yuga Labs. Additionally, Alegre embarked on a comprehensive listening tour to grasp every facet of the business. He aimed to ensure that the team and projects were in perfect alignment with the company’s objectives. However, Alegre soon recognized that several projects, despite their good intentions, either stretched the team’s resources or ventured beyond their core expertise. Hence, the decision to streamline operations and focus on what Yuga Labs does best. Significantly, Yuga Labs remains committed to its thriving communities, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks. Moreover, the company’s acquisition spree in 2022 saw them take over the Web3 ecosystem WENEW and the flagship NFT collection 10KTF. Looking ahead, Yuga Labs is fully invested in its Otherside metaverse strategy. This strategy encompasses gaming, entertainment experiences, and interactive social connections. Additionally, the company is keen on forging new partnerships, reminiscent of its previous collaborations with luxury brand Gucci and social media marketing powerhouse Bad Rhino.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Independent filmmaker Sherone Rabinovitz has released an extended trailer for a documentary on CryptoPunks. The documentary, in development since March 2018, aims to chronicle the revolutionary journey and cultural impact of CryptoPunks. The film offers insights from CryptoPunks creators John Watkinson and Matt Hall and explores themes around its creation. Sherone Rabinovitz, an independent filmmaker, has unveiled an extended trailer for a documentary focusing on CryptoPunks. This iconic pixelated NFT collection played a pivotal role in the NFT art boom of 2021. The documentary has been in the works since March 2018, marking a significant endeavor to chronicle the journey of this revolutionary art form. CryptoPunks, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall, has been a significant player in the digital art space. The trailer released by Rabinovitz offers a glimpse into a 2018 interview with the founders and sheds light on the various themes the film is set to explore. In the trailer, Watkinson shares insights into the creation process of the punks’ accessories, highlighting that CryptoPunks was not a finished product at its launch. The documentary delves into the cultural impact of CryptoPunks, exploring its widespread adoption by celebrities, its presence in conferences, and the intrigue it generated in auction houses. It aims to narrate the story of CryptoPunks to a broader audience beyond the crypto-natives, emphasizing its influence and evolution in the digital art landscape. In 2022, Yuga Labs, renowned for the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, acquired the intellectual property of CryptoPunks from Watkinson and Hall. The acquisition came as the founders felt they were not apt for the day-to-day management of such projects. Since April of this year, the floor price of CryptoPunks has been relatively stable, hovering around 45.19 ether (ETH) or approximately $75,000. However, the documentary by Rabinovitz has yet to have a confirmed release date. It emerges at a time when the initial enthusiasm for NFT-inspired films seems to be waning, with projects like Coinbase’s Bored Apes movie being put on hold and collaborations like Reese Witherspoon’s with World of Women not producing any releases so far. Additionally, Rabinovitz’s work is significant as it strives to bring the CryptoPunks narrative to the mainstream. He noted that while those immersed in the crypto world might be familiar with it, most of the population remains unaware of this digital art phenomenon. Moreover, the documentary must maintain an objective reporting style, focusing solely on relevant information without incorporating promotional tones or opinions. It is meticulously crafted to ensure easy readability, avoid complex sentence structures, and maintain a concise and clear approach to delivering information.",

Blockchain Attracts Corporations and CEOs with Its Innovative Potential, Notes CEO. Rihanna’s NFT Experiment Illustrates Tokenization’s Practicality in the Music Industry. According to Jenny Johnson, the CEO of Franklin Templeton, a globally recognized asset management firm. Johnson shared her insights during CNBC’s Delivering Alpha event, highlighting the transformative impact of tokenization on asset ownership rights. Tokenization, the innovative process of transforming asset ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain, is likened to “securitization on steroids” by Johnson. This comparison underscores the enhanced capabilities and efficiency this technology brings, exceeding the conventional expectations associated with securitization. Johnson’s observations were part of a broader discussion focusing on the prospects of alternative investment vehicles. She emphasized that the influx of available capital and disruptive technological advancements draws more corporations and CEOs towards futuristic investments, such as blockchain technology. Johnson elaborated on the multifaceted benefits of blockchain, stating it facilitates payment mechanisms, enables the integration of smart contracts into tokens, and serves as a reliable general ledger, providing a single source of truth. To illustrate her perspective, Johnson cited the example of renowned singer Rihanna, who recently released one of her hit songs as a nonfungible token (NFT), allowing token holders to earn a share of the streaming royalties. This innovative approach to music distribution and revenue sharing exemplifies the practical applications of tokenization in the entertainment industry. Moreover, Johnson pointed out that athletes could leverage tokenization to their advantage by offering tokens representing a percentage of their future revenue streams to their fans.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK PayPal has unveiled a patent application for innovation in nonfungible token (NFT) transactions. The framework offers flexibility and user convenience and is not limited to digital collectibles. The system could involve an unnamed third-party service provider, with Ethereum highlighted in the application. PayPal has recently unveiled a patent application promising an innovative structure for non-fungible token transactions. Filed in March and disclosed on September 21, the application presents a framework suggesting a blend of flexibility, user convenience, and broader scope. Significantly, the patent points towards the involvement of an unnamed third-party service provider, with Ethereum being explicitly mentioned. Moreover, the proposed ecosystem hints at the potential of fractionalized NFT purchases. This could lead to introduction of governance tokens that may be traded freely. Besides the conventional use of digital collectibles, the patent indicates that the technology could be applied to any form of distinguishable digital data. Such data would then be traceable via a decentralized blockchain ledger. Additionally, the application provides a glimpse into an “omnibus wallet” linked directly to the service provider. In such arrangements, transactions wouldn’t necessitate a record on the blockchain. Consequently, users would be exempt from associated gas fees, marking a stark shift from current standards. Furthermore, an intriguing aspect of PayPal’s vision touches on NFT-related royalties as a potential revenue stream. To enhance user experience, the ecosystem could have a third-party handling storage and checkout services. Hence, compliance and risk management might witness streamlining through the designated service provider. On the topic of currency, the application showcases true versatility. Notably, it mentions that any currency could be incorporated into this structure. This flexibility is particularly relevant when considering PayPal’s recent foray into the cryptocurrency space. In August, the financial giant announced the launch of its dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD ($PYUSD). This move was a landmark event, signifying the first instance of a major U.S. financial entity introducing such a digital asset. However, there are other significant updates from the company. Earlier in August, PayPal’s Board of Directors declared the induction of Alex Chriss, a seasoned Intuit executive, as their new President and CEO. Chriss, who took the helm this month, isn’t new to steering the ship. Having served as Intuit’s Executive Vice President and General Manager for their Small Business and Self-Employed Group since 2019, he played a pivotal role. Responsible for over half of Intuit’s revenue, Chriss spearheaded Mailchimp’s successful $12 billion acquisition in 2021.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Web3 gaming remains a magnet for investors despite market downturns. A recent DappRadar report shows $297 million invested in blockchain gaming. Asia dominates the Web3 gaming sector, while the US focuses on NFTs and DeFi. Despite the broader market’s downturn, Web3 gaming continues to attract significant interest, predominantly from investors in the blockchain technology realm. According to a recent report by DappRadar, a staggering $297 million has been pumped into this niche, with a lion’s share directed toward gaming infrastructure. Moreover, July’s statistics reveal a compelling narrative. Blockchain gaming constituted a substantial 41% of all decentralized app (dapp) activities. Consequently, this surge isn’t merely a flash in the pan but indicative of a larger trend. Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, shed light on the global divide in this arena. He emphasized that while the US leans heavily towards NFTs, culture, and DeFi, Asia emerges as the dominant player in the gaming market. He added, “In gaming, there are essentially no barriers to crafting an engaging crypto game.” Echoing Spencer’s sentiments, Michael Anderson, another co-founder at Framework Ventures, shed light on the not-so-distant future. He hinted at a paradigm where games with ownership features would invariably overshadow their traditional counterparts. However, while the industry shows promise, it’s not without challenges. Scott Sunarto, the dynamic founder and CEO of Argus Labs, voiced concerns at a recent panel discussion at Permissionless II. He highlighted the trend of game studios retrofitting Web2 games with a mere NFT layer. Instead of this superficial approach, Sunarto is an advocate for exploring innovative methods to integrate crypto levers. This, he believes, would elevate Web3 gaming beyond mere collectibles, enhancing its appeal manifold. Additionally, Sunarto touched upon another vital aspect of the gaming world — distribution. He believes gaming providers will lean towards owning their distribution channels. Hence, it’s likely that publishers will drift to their custom chains. Here, they can exert greater control, right from managing gas subsidies to intricate chain-level customizations. Such strategies, Sunarto feels, can not only enhance user experience but also arm game publishers with features that set them apart from competitors.",

John Duff, Henry Smith, Maxwell Roux, and Bruno Nispel are legally challenging Krishna Okhandiar over control and financial irregularities. Plaintiffs allege Okhandiar transferred substantial digital assets from the company’s multi-signature wallet for personal gain. The leadership dispute over the Milady Maker NFT collection, managed by Remilia Corporation, has escalated from online skirmishes to a full-blown courtroom confrontation. The collection, which debuted in August 2021, has achieved substantial market presence, with a total volume of 82,902 ETH, equivalent to over $131 million, on OpenSea. John Duff, Henry Smith, Maxwell Roux, and Bruno Nispel, all associated with Remilia Corporation, have initiated legal proceedings against Krishna Okhandiar, accusing him of misappropriating millions and attempting to monopolize control of the company. This lawsuit, lodged on September 22, follows a separate legal action by Okhandiar earlier in the month. All parties involved have asserted claims to be founders or co-founders of the project. The internal strife within Remilia, once perceived as a DAO, has been simmering since Okhandiar, also known as Charlotte Fang, was unmasked in May 2022 as the individual behind the contentious online alias “Miya.” Despite distancing himself from Remilia and the Milady project and delegating control to Smith and Nispel, tensions flared again when Okhandiar alleged that an unidentified developer had hijacked control of the company’s social media accounts and absconded with $1 million in fees.

They contend that Okhandiar, utilizing his access to the company’s multi-signature wallet, transferred approximately $600,000 worth of digital assets to his personal account and removed an additional $1.7 million from the company’s treasury. However, Okhandiar’s narrative diverges sharply, asserting his sole founder status since January 2021 and dismissing Duff, Smith, and Roux as independent contractors with no equity in the company. He contends that any financial transactions were legitimate, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to any unpaid salaries or bonuses. Moreover, the plaintiffs have revived the year-old “Miya” controversy, highlighting Okhandiar’s alleged history of online antagonism and verbal abuse under various aliases, including Charlotte Fang. Roux has claimed that the working environment was marred by Okhandiar’s abusive and harassing behavior, but the team continued to work on the NFT projects despite the hostile atmosphere. In addition to unpaid wages, the plaintiffs are seeking the establishment of a constructive trust encompassing the assets, funds, and intellectual property related to the NFTs they created. The ongoing legal battle underscores the complexities and challenges emerging in the rapidly evolving NFT space, highlighting the need for clear governance structures and transparent operational practices.",

    "fullContent": "“Never surrender!” the former U.S. president wrote.\nFormer United States President Donald Trump is launching a third nonfungible token (NFT) drop, dubbed “MugShot,” centered around the theme of his ongoing criminal indictments. According to the Dec. 12 announcement, the trading cards are purchasable via either credit card or Wrapped Ether (wETH) and are not transferrable until Dec. 31, 2024. Users must provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information to purchase the NFTs, even if they pay with crypto. In explaining the rationale behind the collection, the collection‘s website reads: Priced at $99 each, users who purchase 47 or more digital trading cards can receive “a piece of the president’s ACTUAL suit from his famous mugshot \u0026 dinner at Mar-a-Lago with the President.” This is Trump’s third NFT drop following previous successes. Melania Trump, former first lady of the United States and wife of Donald Trump, has also previously launched an NFT collection. The 45th U.S. president is currently seeking a non-consecutive second term in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Starting this year, Trump has been indicted by both state and federal authorities on allegations of business fraud and efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, totaling 91 felony charges. However, the U.S. Constitution has no clauses automatically disqualifying suspects or convicted criminals from running for federal office. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which bars convicted insurrectionists from holding public office, requires congressional action to be enforced. https://t.co/0TJzDIcOBP Watch This Video: Don\u0027t Miss Out! pic.twitter.com/vunSPlEY6Z",

    "title": "What is Midjourney, and how to use it to create AI art?",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-midjourney-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-create-ai-art",
    "fullContent": "Uncover what Midjourney is and learn the essentials of using this innovative AI tool to create stunning and unique art pieces.\nMidjourney is a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform that allows users to generate unique artwork such as characters, images and depictions through short text prompts. A generative AI platform is an artificial intelligence system that can generate new and unique content, often in images, text or other creative outputs. Unlike traditional rule-based AI systems designed for specific tasks, generative AI platforms use advanced algorithms, typically based on deep learning techniques, to autonomously produce novel and contextually relevant outputs. Midjourney AI is one such innovative generative AI platform that opens up new possibilities for creative expression and can produce outputs that go beyond what was explicitly programmed, introducing an element of unpredictability and creativity into the AI landscape. This can be applied to various artwork domains to create realistic images that do not exist in the real world. This article discusses what Midjourney AI is, how Midjourney works, effective prompts, how Midjourney is different from Dall-E 2, and the benefits of Midjourney artwork. It will also raise the lingering question: Is it ethical to use AI-generated art? There is also a step-by-step guide to using Midjourney for artists to create unique AI-generated artworks. Related: The ABCD of AI: Automation, big data, computer vision and deep learning Midjourney is a generative AI program and service by the research lab Midjourney, Inc. The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, co-founder of Leap Motion. Like OpenAI’s DALL-E and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, Midjourney creates visuals using natural language descriptions called prompts. Midjourney’s website describes itself as “an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.” It has been in open beta since July 12, 2022, and users can create high-quality artwork with Midjourney using simple text-based prompts in Discord bot commands. No specialized hardware or software is needed to use Midjourney. However, to access the service, it is necessary to have a Discord account. Midjourney operates through the sophisticated interplay of two machine learning technologies: large language models and diffusion models. When users input prompts, a large language model deciphers the meaning of the words and transforms it into a numerical vector. This vector is pivotal in guiding the diffusion process, where Midjourney uses a diffusion model to transform random noise into visually appealing art. Diffusion models involve gradually adding random noise to a training data set of images. The model becomes adept at generating entirely new images by learning to reverse this noise over time. For example, if a user inputs a text prompt such as “Bitcoin mining with bright colors and animated appearance,” Midjourney starts with a field of visual noise. Through latent diffusion, a trained AI model systematically subtracts noise, progressively unveiling an image that embodies the essence of the specified objects and themes in the original prompt. Language comprehension and diffusion modeling synergy empower Midjourney to craft captivating and diverse AI-generated artworks based on user input or prompts. Midjourney beta can only be accessed through a Discord account. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on using Midjourney for creating unique AI-generated images: Existing Discord users can visit Midjourney.com, click the “Join the Beta” button, or go directly to the Midjourney Discord. For those who do not have a Discord account, register to create a free account on Discord first and then join the Midjourney Discord server. You can access the Midjourney Discord from anywhere — web, mobile and desktop applications. When the service first launched in July 2022, anyone could use it to generate 25 images for free. However, this changed in April 2023, with Midjourney pausing the free trial program. Midjourney is no longer freely available except for some brief promotional periods. The pricing plan can be found in the below table. To start, you can go to the channel “#newbies,” followed by a number on the Midjourney Discord server. There are many such channels, and you can pick any one of them. In the newbie channel, enter “/” followed by “imagine” and the prompt for Midjourney to generate the required images. For example, /imagine prompt: “Bitcoin mining in bright colors with an animated appearance.” Another example of a /imagine prompt, “Ethereum blockchain elements in a modern tech setting,” gave the following result: On average, Midjourney takes about a minute to generate four artwork options. However, this is not fixed, and the time may increase if one wants an upscaled image or a non-square aspect ratio output. Midjourney subscription plans have fast and relaxed modes, which will change the generation speed as per the subscribed plan. In the fast mode, waiting in line behind others is unnecessary. However, even the most expensive paid plans have a monthly limit on the number of images generated in fast mode. In the relaxed mode, image requests are sent to a queue. Generation can take anywhere between one and 10 minutes to complete. Additionally, Midjourney has an expensive “Turbo” mode that can be activated with the “/turbo” command. Turbo mode generates new images four times faster but consumes twice as much time from your monthly allowance of the subscription plan. To save the generated image on Midjourney, click on the image to open it in full size, and then right-click and choose the “Save image” option. On mobile, long-tap the image and then tap the download icon in the top right corner. Midjourney allows users to view all previously created images, including the prompts used to generate them. To access previously created Midjourney images on Discord, go to the Discord Inbox “Mention” tab and download previous images. Midjourney images are in the public domain, and ownership is open-source. Midjourney describes itself as an open community that allows others to use and remix images and prompts when posted in a public setting. By default, all images on Midjourney are publically viewable and remixable. Therefore, they can be accessed and modified by anyone. This makes it questionable to sell Midjourney artwork. Dall-E 2 is a text-to-image model and the successor of Dall-E built by the OpenAI research lab that launched ChatGPT. In 2019, OpenAI received over $1 billion in funding from Microsoft and Khosla Ventures, and in January 2023, following the launch of Dall-E 2 and ChatGPT, it received an additional $10 billion in funding from Microsoft. Midjourney is self-funded and built by an independent lab, Midjourney Inc. While Dall-E 2 and Midjourney are based on natural language descriptions that generate images from prompts, usage depends on specific requirements and preferences. Some of the differences are as follows: Midjourney has enabled artists to explore various artistic styles, themes and concepts, fostering creativity and pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms. Artists can experiment with multiple parameters and techniques, resulting in versatile outputs ranging from abstract compositions to realistic representations. It is time-saving owing to the quick AI turnaround for generating images. Furthermore, integration with platforms like Discord enhances the collaborative aspects of Midjourney, allowing artists to share ideas, techniques and creations within a community of like-minded individuals. Besides artistic expression, Midjourney is beneficial for creating product images, illustrations, social media creatives, marketing collaterals, nonfungible token (NFT) art projects, architectural visualizations and more. While AI art is legal, its ethical implications are multifaceted and involve considerations related to creativity, ownership, bias and societal impact. The common contention is that although AI tools contribute to the creation, the input and guidance come from humans. Clear guidelines on attribution and ownership are essential to addressing these issues. The commercial use of AI-generated art raises questions about fair compensation and the potential for plagiarism. Artists should be aware of the ethical implications of selling AI-generated work and how it aligns with established norms in the art world. AI models are trained on data sets that may carry biases present in the data — gender, racial or cultural biases. This can inadvertently lead to biased outputs, reinforcing existing stereotypes or prejudices. Artists and developers need to be conscious of these biases and work to mitigate them. The computational resources required to train and run advanced AI models like Midjourney and Dall-E 2 raise environmental concerns. The ethical discourse should consider the carbon footprint associated with large-scale AI operations.",

Related: Enjin migrates over 200M NFTs from Ethereum to its blockchain The NFT marketplace saw a slight shift as two emerging players took a chunk out of the NFT market, which Ethereum previously dominated. This week, NFTs in the Solana and Bitcoin networks are making strides, with Bitcoin outpacing Ethereum on certain days and Solana catching up in the third position. On Dec. 12, the Bitcoin network surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour sales volume, according to the NFT sales tracker CryptoSlam. NFT sales in Bitcoin went over $24 million, fueled by various Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs raking in millions. The network also beat Ethereum in metrics like the 30-day sales volume, with Bitcoin getting over $463 million in sales vs. Ethereum’s $373 million. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network clocked over $16 million in daily sales as NFT collections like Matr1x Kuku and Pudgy Penguins continue attracting buyers. Furthermore, data shows that the Solana network came in third, with over $6 million in 24-hour sales volume. Solana’s volume is mainly driven by the Tensorians NFT collection, the DeGods NFT project and Gaimin Gladiators. While Bitcoin is making recent gains in the NFT market, the network is still far from beating all-time sales in the Ethereum network, which stands at over $41 billion. Currently, the Bitcoin network has bagged $1 billion in all-time sales and sits at the number six rank.

I have to ensure I’m around for a long time, for those who need me,” Aronow said on Dec. 11 in addressing rumors of a potential return. Aronow explained that some days, he’s ready to throw himself into the “deep end,” while on other days, he feels he needs to be “wheel-chaired” to an emergency room. Hey so I’ve seen a bunch of tweets this week asking / hoping I’ll come back to a leadership role at Yuga. I get where that sentiment is coming from. Couple of things on that: There’s days where I want to throw myself into the deep end, and there’s days, like yesterday, where I… Aronow, also known as Gordon Goner, took leave of absence in late January following a congestive heart failure diagnosis. In the same announcement, Wylie rejected rumors that Yuga Labs used neo-Nazi and racist imagery, referring to them as “lies.” At the time, he said he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser at Yuga Labs. Despite taking a back step, Aronow said he’s had the chance to overlook the operations of Yuga Labs — the team is behind NFT projects Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks — and suggest changes where necessary. “I identified the key issues that have been holding us back, and as of the last board meeting, which was two days ago, I feel like I’ve addressed those issues under no uncertain terms,” he explained. That said, Aronow is backing the current leadership in what could be a make-or-break year for the firm in 2024: Aronow previously explained that he was reluctant to take a step back, but his condition had deteriorated so rapidly that he had no other option but to deprioritize his work. “I pushed myself way past my limits. I worked 12 hours a day, nearly every day. I should have taken the advice from everyone around me and sought balance.” Related: BAYC creator Yuga Labs completes restructuring to focus on metaverse About a month before Aronow’s leave of absence, the firm announced Daniel Alegre — former president and chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard — as its new CEO.

The market currently accounts for an estimated $154 billion in spending. The report analyzed global sales data for blockchain game products from 2017 to 2021. It found that sales were increasing by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8%, implying that by 2030, the market will have reached $600 billion. This equates to an absolute growth rate over the six-year period of nearly 299%. Fortune’s researchers divided the world into five regions: North America, South America, Middle East/Africa, Europe and Asia Pacific. North America posted the largest share of blockchain game item purchases for any region in 2022, accounting for over $30 billion, or approximately 24% of the total. The researchers stated that they expect this North American dominance to continue. When it comes to the category of games offered, the report stated that it expects role-playing games to have the highest growth rate when compared to other categories. These games have “special characters, themes, additional weapons, accessories, and other features” that make them especially suited to implementing blockchain features. Role-playing games represented over 33% of the market in 2022, it stated. Web-based blockchain games currently represent the largest segment of blockchain games, which the researchers expect to continue dominating. However, they also stated that Android-based games are becoming more prevalent.

    "fullContent": "Atlas Development Services executive Oscar Franklin Tan told Cointelegraph that to avoid the gas fees for transferring 200 million NFTs, it took a different approach in the migration.\nNonfungible token (NFT) platform Enjin recently migrated over 200 million NFTs from Ethereum and a sidechain to its own Enjin Blockchain. In an announcement received by Cointelegraph, Enjin noted that over 118 million NFTs hosted on Ethereum, along with over 101 million NFTs hosted in an Ethereum sidechain called JumpNet, have been transferred to its mainnet called the Enjin Blockchain. In June, the NFT platform announced the creation of its own blockchain. Enjin said the new network embedded NFT-focused features such as NFT transfers and royalty enforcement into the blockchain’s foundational code. With the transition, users will experience several changes, such as the built-in royalties and a new feature called “Fuel Tanks,” which lets developers subsidize gas fees for users. According to the announcement, the platform will use this feature to give users free transactions across its ecosystem for three months. On Dec. 6, executives working in the gaming industry weighed in on the future of blockchain gaming and highlighted several catalysts to Web3 adoption in gaming. Bartosz Skwarczek, the founder and CEO of G2A Capital Group, told Cointelegraph that improvements in accessibility and user interfaces would attract a broader gamer audience to Web3. Similarly, Rene Stefancic, the chief operating officer of Atlas Development Services, a core contributor to the Enjin Blockchain, said that the push to a different blockchain could potentially allow Web3 to “tap into the three billion-strong global gamer market.” Related: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of Atlas, told Cointelegraph that to avoid an “incredible amount of gas fees” for transferring over 200 million NFTs, the platform has taken a different approach with their migration. Tan said: Tan explained that this process lets users claim without paying for gas. However, one potential drawback is that instead of the NFTs being burned in Ethereum, they will still exist on the previous networks. “Creators have to ask holders not to trade them and consider the Enjin Blockchain versions the official versions,” Tan added.

    "fullContent": "Users who deposit digital assets to exchanges in South Korea will be eligible to receive interest on their deposits.\nSouth Korean regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), published a notice highlighting that by July 2024, investors in digital assets must receive interest when depositing their funds into an exchange. However, the guidance clarified that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are excluded from the law. On Dec. 10, local media outlets reported the FSC plans to release the legislative guidance. Despite the exclusion of NFTs, the regulator also noted that there can be exceptions. According to the report, even if the tokens are categorized as NFTs but function as a payment method and are issued in large quantities, they may be included in the virtual asset classification. In this case, the assets may be eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. Apart from classifying virtual assets, the South Korean regulator also determined the method for handling user deposits for virtual asset operators. The notice highlighted that exchanges must separate user deposits and their own assets and entrust these to a bank. In addition, 80% of the coins must be kept in a cold wallet. Related: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report The guidance will also include requirements for preparing for hacks or other computer incidents. The regulator said that virtual asset service providers should sign up for insurance or accumulate reserves. Meanwhile, the law also prohibits the blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it’s absolutely necessary and when requested by courts and financial regulators. South Korea has been solidifying its regulations on the crypto space. Earlier in December, financial regulators in the country asked users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges offering services within the region. The Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea were in charge of the initiative.

The report highlighted that the NFT industry maintained upward momentum for the second month in a row. Trading volume surged by 125% in November, suggesting a shift in user behavior compared to earlier downturns in NFT trading. On Nov. 6, analytics firm Nansen reported that NFT sales volumes showed continued weekly increases in October. NFT sales consistently went up, from $56 million in the week ending on Oct. 9 to $129 million in the week ending on Nov. 5. Executives working in Web3 believe that this trend may continue further in the coming months. On Nov. 14, SuperRare co-founder Jonathan Perkins told Cointelegraph that the worst of the bear market is “behind us” and things are starting to turn around. Apart from the uptick in trading volume, the average value of NFT transactions also increased by 114%, climbing from $126 to $270 in November.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/armenian-cultural-heritage-sites-get-tokenized-on-solana-blockchain",
    "fullContent": "The initiative “Realm of Historia” is on a mission to tokenize historical sites in Armenia and around the world using the blockchain to preserve cultural heritage for future generations.\nThe Realm of Historia project recently announced its intentions to make strides in preserving Armenian cultural heritage through leveraging the use of blockchain technology and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In a departure from conventional methods, this initiative seeks to digitize historical artifacts and physical historical sites, starting with the Realm of Historia: Carahunge X digital asset collection. Cointelegraph spoke with the two creators of Realm of Historia, Ivan Grantovsky and Ivan Krylov, about how emerging technologies can preserve culture and connect new generations with history. At the core of Realm of Historia’s effort is the Solana blockchain, which the two developers said was chosen for efficiency and transparency purposes. Krylov said part of the inspiration for creating a platform is the lack of engaging platforms that digitally present cultural heritage and are transparent with how to participate philanthropically. The Realm of Historia: Carahunge X collection aims to digitize the tangible essence of the Carahunge site, known as the Stonehenge of Armenia, which dates back to 5487 BC. All the NFTs in the collection combine art and digital versions of the stones from the physical site. In addition to digitizing pieces of cultural heritage, the project also aims to support local artists in Armenia and has collaborations with entities like the Yerevan Biennial Art Foundation (YBAF), A1 Art Space and Latitude Art Space. 1 | Born in Yerevan, Armenia, amidst a family of artists, Lilit Eghiazaryan\u0027s journey in the realm of art was predestined pic.twitter.com/LEwznJfVB5 The founders of Realm of Historia said they see this project playing a pivotal role in bridging cultural divides, empowering local artists and showcasing Armenia’s cultural richness through emerging tech. Related: How generative AI allows one architect to reimagine ancient cities The project has a physical-digital aspect in the form of a QR code accompanying each NFT that can be scanned and redeemed in local cafes, museums and other sites in Armenia that have partnered with the project, they said. This initiative aligns with a broader global trend recognizing blockchain’s potential in cultural heritage preservation. The decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain ensures a reliable record of historical assets, guaranteeing their unaltered accessibility for future generations. In a similar project in Ukraine, a local art museum used blockchain digitization and NFTs to document and preserve art and cultural heritage during wartime. More recently, The Sandbox Web3 metaverse platform collaborated with the British Museum to bring art and history to the metaverse in physical-digital experiences. The team behind Realm of Historia also plans to build “The Atrium” or a “virtual museum hall” where users can enter a 3D lobby dedicated to cultural heritage and the sites represented by the project. In 2022, the island of Tuvalu, which is rapidly sinking into the sea, announced similar plans to build a digital version of itself to preserve its history as it faces erasure due to climate change. The Realm of Historia founders said their goal is to eventually go beyond Armenia and build collections “everywhere we can all over the world.” They said they’re in talks about potential preservation projects in Malta, Italy, Cambodia and Georgia.

Some X users have responded to the band’s post by saying, “Heavy metal and NFTs! Sign me up!” Cointelegraph reached out to Megadeth for further comment on the collection. Megadeth is one of the world’s most popular heavy metal groups. However, it is not the first in its genre to hop into the Web3 space.

    "fullContent": "Wemade CEO Henry Chang said that as more developers gain confidence, there will be greater experimentation and more complex use of blockchain elements in games.\nAs Web3 gaming showed resilience despite the crypto bear market, professionals working in the space predict that the next year will be more eventful for the blockchain gaming niche. Henry Chang, the CEO of the South Korean game development company Wemade, believes that there will be an increase in blockchain-based games released in 2024. Chang told Cointelegraph in a statement that there will be more complex applications of Web3 within games. Chang said: Besides the number of games coming out, Chang also suggested that more gaming studios are bound to include Web3 in their portfolio. The executive believes that this is due to the inherent characteristics of blockchain gaming, which allows it to provide new revenue streams, create new experiences and make community engagement more immersive through token-gated benefits. Chang also pointed out that gaming combined with the blockchain returns in-game asset ownership to gamers, connects the real-world economy to games and makes games interoperable by tying them into “a cohesive whole.” Bartosz Skwarczek, the founder and CEO of G2A Capital Group, the company behind the gaming marketplace G2A, echoed many of Chang’s sentiments and said there will be more collaboration between traditional industry players and Web3 startups in 2024. According to a press release on Nov. 2, Microsoft backed Chang’s Wemade with its Web3 push. On Nov. 16, Skwarczek’s G2A, which is a digital game marketplace, opened its own nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace focused on Web3 games.

Related: NFT sales volume upward trend to continue, industry execs say While there are many things to look forward to in 2024, one of blockchain gaming’s biggest challenges is onboarding a more extensive player base. According to Chang, blockchain technology is complex for most game designers and developers. This means users themselves will have a hard time understanding the technology. Despite these hurdles, Chang believes that making it easier for developers to integrate Web3 elements into their games and making the blockchain parts more intuitive and native to games could solve the issue. The executive believes that making these things easier for your average gamer to understand will allow them to adapt much faster, leading to broader adoption of Web3 in gaming. Meanwhile, Skwarczek reiterated that there has to be “one groundbreaking Web3 title” that will set the standard for blockchain gaming and enhance players’ overall experience. “That is the missing piece that will get Web3 attention and mass adoption,” Skwarczek added.

    "fullContent": "Animoca Brands became the biggest validator of the TON blockchain in 2023, banking on the network effect of Telegram’s 800 million users to drive GameFi adoption.\nAnimoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu is confident that a number of investments and partnerships could prove fruitful in 2024 as mainstream institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC) gathers steam. Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph at the Next Block Expo event in Berlin, the chairman of the gaming venture capital firm highlights some 70 investments made in 2023 that are expected to deliver results next year. Chief among these is a high-profile partnership with The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which was announced on Nov. 28. Siu confirmed that the investment involved the purchase of an undisclosed amount of Toncoin, which was then staked as part of the validator agreement: Siu also said that Animoca’s acquisition of the social casual gaming platform Gamee in July 2020 is set to capitalize on its growing presence as a gaming platform on Telegram. He adds that the acquisition was hampered by an inability to monetize games through the messaging application. “There were no advertising and in-app purchases, and nothing was allowed in Telegram until recently with the integration of TON. So now they’re commercially viable,” Siu explained. While Gamee is not yet fully integrated into Telegram, the appreciation of its native GMEE token is a strong indicator of “GameFi excitement and its potential on Telegram.” Animoca also has a vested interest in the wider performance of metaverse projects and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Siu says the NFT market is recovering thanks to long-term holders who placed value in the respective projects and the fundamentals backing them: He adds that the number of NFTs from various high-profile collections available to buy on the market is “typically now in single digit percentage.” This starkly contrasts with the bull market in 2021, where more than half of a given collection was listed for sale on NFT marketplaces. Macro factors also give Siu reason to be bullish as 2024 looms on the horizon. He points to the building anticipation around Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the U.S., the end of Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial and Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement with American authorities as key reasons for positive sentiment going into the new year: The potential approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 adds to the strong foundation, according to Siu. The recent liquidation of $60 million of BTC short positions also alleviates downward pressure on the markets.",

    "fullContent": "The protocol will expand to liquid staking and layer-2 solutions while retaining its NFT lending services.\nDespite rebranding to Parallel Finance for a greater focus on the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, the nonfungible token (NFT) lending protocol ParaSpace will continue to focus on its core product amid sector woes. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Yubo Ruan, founder and CEO of ParaSpace (now Parallel Finance), explains that the protocol uses a combination of diversified liquidity pools, dynamic loan-to-value ratios and price-discovery partnerships to mitigate the risks associated with high volatility, which can often result in a lack of bidders on the underlying asset. “Despite the market downturn, we believe NFT margin lending remains viable,” said Ruan. “It serves a niche yet growing sector of collectors and investors looking for leverage in their investments.” During the past year, NFT trading volume has plunged by 99% from its peak in May 2022, although there have been signs of stabilization with blue chip collections. “In the near future, we see the implementation of NFTs as digital passports that enable access to both virtual and real-world utilities,” Ruan commented. “Also, we’re looking at the evolution of soulbound tokens that serve as non-transferable proofs of experience, skill and reputation.” As the protocol rebrands to offer a greater variety of DeFi services, Ruan said the two main focuses are liquid staking and Parallel L2. Along with the stated aims of achieving fast transactions with low gas fees, Parallel L2 also incorporates zero-knowledge proofs and Arbitrum Orbi to optimize for security and scalability. Meanwhile, Ruan explained that the protocol is “exploring the possibilities of integrating liquid staking with NFT lending” to allow NFT holders to earn yields on their staked assets.

    "fullContent": "This eco-friendly blockchain ecosystem redefines financial stability by integrating gold, offering a sustainable and inclusive economic model.\nThe economic landscape has been in a state of flux since the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent shockwaves through numerous industries. However, the seeds of economic instability were sown during the 2008 U.S. housing crisis. In 2023, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, a barometer of public perception of the economy, is hovering near its lowest point since 2008. This suggests that consumer confidence remains fragile, casting a shadow over the economic recovery.  The 2008 financial crisis spawned Bitcoin as an alternative monetary system, but the burgeoning crypto landscape has been plagued by speculative trading. Blockchain technology possesses a unique combination of attributes that can safeguard transaction security, transparency, and efficiency. Nevertheless, the industry must restore trust, and gold can serve as a catalyst for this. The FRUITS Eco-Blockchain Project plans to leverage gold to build an eco-friendly and sustainable economy open to everyone. Fruits uses a unique consensus mechanism called proof-of-capacity (PoC), which performs a sustainable economic cycle with minimal power consumption while achieving high security. The PoC eliminates transaction fees altogether, offering the ideal infrastructure for building economies for charity and everyday transfers. Powered by its native FRTS coin, the Fruits ecosystem facilitates rapid and cost-effective transactions through the PoC consensus mechanism. FRTS enables users to acquire distinctive gold-backed nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Fruits’ NFT marketplace, generate passive income through decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities, and contribute to charitable endeavors. To build an inclusive financial system and support charity, Fruits develops a digital money transfer ecosystem called the FRUITS Social Finance Platform. It will include a financial transaction-focused cryptocurrency exchange, a multi-coin FRUITS wallet and a charity crowdfunding platform.  Source: FRUITS The Fruits ecosystem intends to introduce gold-pegged stablecoins and gold ingot NFTs, with gold serving as a cornerstone of the ecosystem. The precious metal is inextricably linked to a stable and trustworthy economy, and integrating it into the crypto space will foster a shift from speculative trading toward a more grounded and utilitarian approach. To encourage gold adoption in the blockchain space and drive the use of crypto, Fruits launched a Web3 game that offers players a chance to win real gold while playing. Gaming has often been used as a testing ground for blockchain and Web3 innovation, and the Fruits team developed an interactive title that not only reshapes entertainment but also offers new ways to create wealth. The play-for-gold (P4G) game, called Golden Egg Wonderland, enables users to earn gold-backed NFTs by raising and crossbreeding “Turtoris” — special beautiful birds that can generate golden eggs. Fruits has a patent-pending method to facilitate the conversion of the golden egg NFTs to physical gold eggs. The method uses a matching serial number, enabling users to swap the NFT for real gold at the Golden Egg NFT exchange. The physical gold is mined and refined at Fruits’ partner Gold CIP Plant GOLDEXT in Tanzania. There are several ways players can obtain eggs: Regular eggs can be hatched to obtain birds that can be nurtured and crossbred. Eventually, players may become lucky to end up with a golden egg, which can be redeemed for physical gold.  Source: FRUITS The Fruits team harbors a vision for a multi-layered social finance platform that seamlessly facilitates conversions between various digital assets, including the major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), encompassing their native FRTS coin, Golden Egg Wonderland assets, gold ingot NFTs, and fiat currencies. This structure will create a seamless conversion path where users can easily exchange gold-backed assets for FRTS and subsequently for BTC or other cryptocurrencies, and vice versa. This ambitious endeavor aims to establish Fruits as a comprehensive financial hub, catering to the needs of both experienced crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to the digital asset landscape.

    "fullContent": "A new NFT-powered game is vowing to continue Pokémon’s legacy — allowing players to collect mythical creatures in an immersive world.\nFor ’90s kids, Pokémon was transformative — and millions were engrossed by the beautifully designed trading card game. Now, a new NFT-powered game aims to continue its incredible impact, attracting a whole new generation in the process. AneeMate is the brainchild of Web3 developer QORPO World — and blends adventure and exploration in an environment where players are tasked with collecting magnificent creatures. Pokémon’s enduring popularity is evident in the staggering number of trading cards sold (over 53 billion), with Nintendo shifting tens of millions of video games across the franchise. Even the mobile game Pokémon GO, which allowed players to catch Pokémon in the real world, was a smash hit. But there’s one game-changing technological innovation that the Pokémon world is yet to embrace, despite the fact it’s a natural evolution for players vying to complete their Pokédex. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) can supercharge the power of games — allowing users to genuinely own assets and put them to work in new ways. It also opens the door to a player-driven economy where in-game assets can be bought and sold on secondary markets — democratizing access to coveted items. Now, a new contender is poised to enter the arena, offering a fresh and innovative take on the Pokémon-style formula: AneeMate, a brainchild of QORPO World. AneeMate is an upcoming open-world, cross-genre game that invites players to embark on an enchanting journey through a whimsical land teeming with myth and mystery. The game seamlessly integrates elements of adventure, exploration, creature collecting, and RPG, catering to a wide spectrum of gaming enthusiasts.

Summon a battle arena on-demand (delivered via drone) and engage in strategic turn-based battles against other players. Dive into multiplayer adventures… pic.twitter.com/U01SquI0vH Game developers want to appeal to players who love Pokémon-style worlds — and incorporate multiple gaming genres. At the heart of AneeMate lies the quest to capture and train an array of extraordinary creatures known as AneeMates. These fantastical beings, each possessing unique abilities and characteristics, are scattered throughout the game’s vast and diverse landscapes, waiting to be discovered and befriended. Players must navigate treacherous terrains, solve intricate puzzles, and outwit formidable foes in their pursuit of these elusive creatures. Determined players will have a chance to fill their MateBook — the complete collection of AneeMates across five categories: fire, electric, water, earth and psychic. They’re scattered across Hidden Island and need to be freed from a life of hardship and extortion. But malevolent bosses and a treacherous environment await — meaning gamers need to show remarkable survival skills for any chance of success. Each AneeMate, as well as human characters, can be upskilled — allowing them to learn new abilities and outwit enemies as the game gets progressively harder.  Beyond the captivating gameplay, AneeMate integrates NFTs into the game’s ecosystem. This approach grants players true ownership of their digital assets, allowing them to trade, sell, and utilize their AneeMates in a player-driven economy. Limited NFT drops that feature a few rare collectibles have been released. Additionally, the AneeMate Genesis Drop offers a chance for players to become early adopters and secure access to the alpha test, NFT royalties, and a whitelist for the QORPO token. As AneeMate prepares to make its mark on the gaming landscape, it has already garnered attention and anticipation. The recent AneeMate Stickers Book challenge was successful, with over 20,000 NFT stickers minted, approximately 1,000 Stickers Books completed, and a significant increase in social media followers. In addition, the team launched the Genesis Zero NFT sale for AneeMate on the native QORPO WORLD platform. New AneeMates are going to be added to the game with every passing season, meaning there will always be new creatures in need of saving. The game was built using Unreal Engine 5 — delivering a powerful and immersive experience — and an alpha test is going to be available on Windows and PS5. QORPO’s CEO and founder, Rastislav Bakala, said: “We offer a special opportunity to own your childhood again with AneeMates, own your piece of the game and participate in the project’s success via a player-driven economy thanks to token whitelists and NFT royalties.” AneeMate’s journey is just beginning, but with its blend of Pokémon-style charm, open-world exploration, and NFT integration, the game is poised to redefine the gaming landscape and captivate players worldwide.

Citing anonymous sources, media outlet Bloomberg reported that the investment company marked down its stakes on BAYC by 69% and on OpenSea by 94%. In addition, the company also slashed valuations for multiple other portfolio companies, according to the report. Cointelegraph reached out to Tiger Global for comments but did not get an immediate response. Tiger Global has been actively investing in various areas in the crypto space. Apart from NFTs, the firm also invests in blockchain security and privacy-focused projects. In 2021, Tiger Global co-led a $24 million funding round for blockchain security firm CertiK as it made efforts to expand its security offerings for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. In 2022, it participated in a Series B investment round for the zero-knowledge applications platform Aleo. The privacy project raised $200 million, with investors like Kora Management LP and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 leading the investment round. The same year, Tiger Global also invested in the layer-2 network Polygon.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-sales-web3-pricing-cryptocurrency-luck-scarcity-optimism",
    "fullContent": "Several new research studies indicate that personal experiences may be the NFT market’s primary mover.\nA trio of studies published in November may shine some light on the social and psychological factors that motivate movement in the nonfungible token (NFT) market. Across three independent studies, researchers from Western University in Canada, Tilburg University in the Netherlands, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the United States, and Rennes School of Business in France found that personal experiences and luck, along with asset scarcity and consumer optimism, were catalysts for the majority of market movement in the NFT space. In a study conducted by Guneet Kaur Nagpal of Western University and Luc Renneboog of Tilburg University titled “On Non-fungible Tokens, Blockchain Hypes, and the Creation of Scarcity,” the researchers analyzed the market dynamics of CryptoPunks, a popular collection of NFT assets. “CryptoPunks,” write the researchers, “are among the most valued Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), with remarkable sales such as CP #5822 fetching USD 23.7 million in February 2022, and CP #7523 obtaining USD 11.8 million in December 2021.” The primary findings, according to the paper, include the assessment that buyers who were already invested in Ether (ETH), the native coin of Ethereum — the blockchain on which CryptoPunks assets reside — were more likely to engage in the market at higher costs and also saw higher gains. The researchers also noted that ETH gains and losses didn’t necessarily affect the price of NFTs but did influence the decision to sell or resell assets. Furthermore, the study states: In a separate study titled “Personal Experience Effects across Markets: Evidence from NFT and Cryptocurrency Investing,” researcher Chuyi Sun of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examined transaction-level data from “about one million” wallets to study how “personal experiences” contributed to bubbles in the NFT market. ”I find that NFT investors who randomly receive more valuable NFTs in the primary market are more likely to participate in subsequent primary market sales,” wrote Sun, adding that investors who randomly receive more valuable NFTs are more likely to eventually purchase “more lottery-like” cryptocurrencies. A third study, titled “The Impact of Experience, Overconfidence and Optimism on Future Cryptocurrency Ownership” and conducted by Akanksha Jalan and Roman Matkovskyy of Rennes School of Business, takes a deep dive into the dynamics surrounding investor optimism and their knock-on effect for the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Related: The ‘WAGMI’ mentality is undermining crypto In this study, the researchers found, counter-intuitively, that negative past experiences and investor optimism both positively affect the odds of future cryptocurrency and NFT ownership. “The fact that individual crypto investors with negative experiences with cryptocurrencies continue to show interest in the asset class could reflect some form of self-serving bias,” wrote the authors, before adding, “with these investors likely attributing their losses to factors beyond their control (like market volatility) rather than poor decision-making on their part.”",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-nft-marketplace-bioniq-congestion",
    "fullContent": "Bioniq operates on the Internet Computer Protocol, tapping into native Bitcoin integration to ease the network congestion and high fees associated with Ordinals inscriptions.\nA new Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace aims to reduce network fees associated with the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions by tapping into the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Developed off the back of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq operates on the ICP and taps into its native Bitcoin integration to power the trade of Bitcoin-based Ordinals inscriptions. Speaking to Cointelegraph on the eve of the platform’s launch, Bioniq CEO and co-founder Bob Bodily said the project has been in development since February 2023. The team has built a marketplace featuring Ordinals smart contracts auctions on the ICP, a complete cross-chain wallet between Bitcoin and the ICP, as well as an inscription tool. The Bioniq team highlighted the growth in the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens since their inception in Jan. 2023. The market cap now exceeds $3 billion, with over 42.6 million Ordinals minted to date. This has directly affected Bitcoin network congestion, leading to a spike in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees last seen since 2021. Bioniq’s platform features a smart wallet for users to manage private keys using Web3Auth. This allows users to log into the platform using conventional Web2 Google accounts while maintaining noncustodial control of their wallets and assets. The platform also uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) through the ICP’s Bitcoin network integration. This unlocks smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin, removing the need for users to use centralized cross-chain bridges. Building on ICP also allows Bioniq to claim transaction finality times below two seconds, as well as zero gas or network fees. Its architecture provides optimized storage costs, averaging around $5 per gigabyte of data stored annually. Bodily added that Toniq, the studio behind Bioniq, has been developing on the ICP since May 2021 and has extensive experience building smart contract wallets, marketplaces, NFT launchpads and collateralized NFT lending protocols: Bodily explains that ICP operates a Bitcoin light node running fully on-chain, which facilitates reading the Bitcoin blockchain via native smart contract calls. The ICP also has a threshold digital signature algorithm, known as an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The implementation allows ICP smart contracts to sign layer-1 Bitcoin transactions and broadcast them to the mempool. “These protocol primitives also enabled us to build an Ordinals wrapper entirely at the application layer; we didn’t have to touch the consensus layer of the protocol at all. So it is very fast to build Bitcoin tech on ICP right now,” Bodily added. Cointelegraph also inquired whether Bioniq’s wrapping process could be a potential barrier to entry for users. Bodily admits that while the process is largely automated by the Bioniq wallet and only requires BTC, there are two considerations that are pertinent for more discerning users. “Wrapping requires a Bitcoin transaction. This means you have to pay in order to wrap. This is a significant barrier. One way we are addressing the problem is by integrating open Nostr PSBT listings into Bioniq,” Bodily explained. This integration means that PSBT listings stored on Nostr through decentralized Ordinals marketplaces OpenOrdex or Deezy Place will be accessible on Bioniq. He added that it removes the need to wrap Bitcoin transactions, as users could list directly on Bioniq using open PSBTs. Perhaps more importantly, Bodily explained that the wrapping process requires “trust assumptions” on both protocols: Bodily adds that Bioniq is focusing on developing user experience ahead of inheriting Bitcoin’s security, which is ensured by the finality of layer-1 transactions. However, he envisions a “nice decentralization path” for applications like Bioniq. This would involve the evolution from being built on a sidechain with additional trust assumptions to “becoming a Bitcoin sovereign rollup on ICP that is trust minimized.” The final step would see Bioniq becoming a Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) on the ICP with no additional trust assumptions, inheriting the full security and decentralization of Bitcoin. A number of NFT marketplaces already offer Bitcoin Ordinals auctions and trading, which begs the question of what an exclusively Ordinals platform will bring to the ecosystem. Bodily believes that existing offerings that featured “softer pivots” to Ordinals on their platforms were hamstrung by confusing user experiences. Developing a “dedicated Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, built for Bitcoin users natively” hinges on developing a native cross-chain, BTC-ICP wallet. In addition, Bitcoin’s unchallenged position as the preeminent and largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains another drawcard for the continued interest in Bitcoin NFTs into the future. Bioniq joins the likes of Ordinals Market as a Bitcoin-only Ordinals marketplace. Gamma is another Ordinals marketplace that directly mints to Bitcoin’s layer-1 chain. Ordswap was an early Ordinals marketplace that has since closed down after losing control of its website to hackers. Meanwhile, multichain platforms like Magic Eden prominently list Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs.",

    "fullContent": "The soccer star’s Binance-tied NFTs allegedly promoted investments in unregistered securities on the crypto exchange.\nPro-soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has been hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit from plaintiffs claiming they suffered losses from his promotion of the now-legally embroiled crypto exchange Binance. A Nov. 27 filing to a United States district court in Florida claimed Ronaldo “promoted, assisted in, and/or actively participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in coordination with Binance.” Binance entered a multiyear partnership with Ronaldo in mid-2022 to promote a series of his own nonfungible tokens (NFTs), with at least three of the soccer star’s collections tied to Binance. The complaint claims users who signed up for Ronaldo’s NFTs were more likely to use Binance for other purposes, such as investing in what they claim are unregistered securities, including Binance’s BNB (BNB) and its crypto yield programs. Ronaldo was a key part of Binance’s growing popularity due to his influence and reach, with 850 million followers across social media, says the complaint. They allege his NFT sales were “incredibly successful” at promoting the exchange, with a 500% increase in searches for Binance the week following the initial sale. Cooking something up with @binance https://t.co/FMAP5GAdxE The suit alleges Ronaldo knew or should have known “about Binance selling unregistered crypto securities,” as he has “investment experience and vast resources to obtain outside advisers.” Related: Why Binance’s US plea deal could be positive for crypto adoption The suit cited U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance warning celebrities of the need to disclose payments received for promoting cryptocurrencies, which the complaint claims Ronaldo didn’t do. The class-action lawsuit plaintiffs are Michael Sizemore, Mikey Vongdara and Gordon Lewis, who seek damages and funds to cover legal fees. Meanwhile, Binance and its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao are facing their own legal woes, pleading guilty and paying a $4.3 billion settlement to the U.S. government for violations of Anti-Money Laundering laws and running an unregistered money-transmitting business. Zhao has stepped down as CEO and faces up to 18 months in prison. Binance has agreed to up to five years of compliance monitoring by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. The SEC has also sued Binance, claiming — among other charges — that it sold unregistered securities and is reportedly investigating if Binance misappropriated customer funds.

Related: 3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market We’re in a complex environment where even the most skilled and visionary founders find it challenging to navigate the market dynamics. This often leaves a trail of unfinished projects and unfulfilled promises, further eroding trust in the sector. Imagine a party with tickets priced at $100. Someone eager to attend with friends misses the initial sale. Turning to the secondary market, they pay $500 for a ticket. The likelihood of disappointment is high since the event intended to offer a $100 experience. With a $500 ticket, expectations are inevitably higher, which often means the experience doesn’t match reality. In the crypto market, this greed-induced frustration is apparent. You can pay 20 Ether (ETH) for an NFT that initially sold for 0.5 ETH, but it is essential to align your expectations with the 0.5 ETH value. (That’s especially true considering how Web3 royalties have declined, a situation that has also prevented founders from obtaining the benefits of high-value secondary sales.) Placing your mental emphasis on the first price you see for an item — instead of taking the full context into account — is known as anchoring bias, where initial information heavily influences later decisions and perceptions. That means buyers view the high price of NFTs they purchase as an “anchor” for their expectations regarding utility, leading to a cycle of disappointment. Developing a quality product takes time. But the market often expects unrealistically quick progress. That expectation puts immense pressure on builders and founders, who find themselves in a cycle of continual announcements to satisfy the community’s desire for constant stimulation and progress. In the last cycle, big gaming projects offered one example of this phenomenon. Some individuals believed that ambitious AAA games — built on Unreal Engine 5 — would be delivered in mere months, even though they typically require three to five years of development. They dumped their tokens when they realized it would take longer, as one year feels like 10 when you’re addicted to volatility. In some cases, opening the process of building to the public is a blessing that Web3 has made possible. However, it can also create a toxic climate that negatively affects the mindset and well-being of project founders. Studies have indicated that roughly 75% of venture-backed startups fail. Like startups, NFT collections operate in risky, experimental environments. Yet, the market often overlooks the risk, instead expecting indefinite success and growth. This is highly driven by confirmation bias, a psychological phenomenon that involves putting an emphasis on information that aligns with a person’s existing beliefs and preferences while ignoring contradictory evidence. During the previous bull run, this was epitomized by “WAGMI,” an acronym for “We’re all going to make it.” But in a market driven by buying and selling, some participants must lose in order for others to win. That, unfortunately, means there is no WAGMI — especially in an environment with low financial literacy and a lot of anxiety. This combination can be particularly dangerous as it leads to decisions driven more by emotion than rational analysis. Related: History tells us we’re in for a strong bull market with a hard landing On the bright side, the ecosystem has evolved a lot since 2021. The good projects that managed to adapt to market changes and the market context are becoming more evident, and there has also been significant human maturation. Many founders became “CEOs” overnight, which is analogous to changing a car’s tires while it’s moving at 100 miles per hour — 24 hours per day, seven days per week. After almost three years and some pivots, many of these CEOs and teams are much more mature, prepared and focused on delivering something of value. And while success depends largely on them, it also depends on the maturity of the Web3 community. Good leaders will not be enough to fix the game if it’s broken by excessive greed, anxiety and irrationality. Investors should consider this — and try to improve, financially and personally — as we enter the next bull run.

On Nov. 27, nonfungible token (NFT) collector “Crumz” detailed his run-in with a scammer posing as a Forbes journalist. He reported that someone pretending to be Robert LaFanco — a real Forbes editor — contacted him by direct message from an impersonator account with the offer of an interview for a new article about BAYC. SCAM ALERT!! I just spent the last 2hours on Zoom with \u0027@Forbes\u0027 it was pretty sophisticated and well thought out because I\u0027m usually on high alert but luckily I wasn\u0027t caught. Here\u0027s what they did. 1/8 During the interview, the scammer prompted Crumz to click a button to allow access to record the interview. Crumz said he complied with the so-called journalists despite certain red flags, including their use of a non-premium Zoom account and wanting to use a separate recorder bot to record his screen. “I had to press a button to allow access to record,” he said before adding, “I didn’t think much of it first, but at the end, he asks me to say something that resembles my ape, and he suggests a banana.” Crumz said he later realized this was a distraction attempt to take him away from his computer during which the attacker would take control of his computer to steal his assets. Crumz said instead of getting the banana, he waited by his computer and sure enough, the scammers started to control his screen. 8/8 Hopefully I\u0027m safe now. Don\u0027t think they can still control my computer when I turn it back on. Please be safe out there, it could\u0027ve been a dreadful day today Crypto casino Rollbit partner borowik.eth echoed the warning to his 140,000 X (formerly Twitter) followers on Nov. 27. He also fingered a spurious account named Robert LaFranco, whose profile claims he is a Forbes assistant managing editor. “During this interview, he attempts to trick you to gain access to your PC and steal your expensive NFTs,” he warned. ⚠️ WATCH OUT ⚠️ A fake Forbes journalist is reaching out to BAYC holders for a fake interview During this interview he attempts to trick you to gain access to your PC and steal your expensive NFTs It’s very unlikely Forbes would reach out pic.twitter.com/ViYrT0mk1l Meanwhile, BAYC community member Laura Rod also reported being contacted by the bogus Forbes editor. Related: Nansen phishing emails flood crypto investors’ inboxes Earlier in November, blockchain security firm Slowmist detailed a number of scams in which victims lost crypto assets to fake journalists. It reported that, after scheduling an interview, the attacker would guide victims to join the interview on Telegram, providing an interview outline, conducting a two-hour interview and then providing the malicious link to consent to publication. In October, a Friend.tech user reported being duped by a fake Bloomberg journalist, who lured them into clicking a link for a “consent form,” which instead resulted in a drained Friend.tech account. Meanwhile, several industry observers have noted that scammers on X often have a BAYC profile picture, which is something to look out for.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/azuki-dao-rebrands-bean-drops-lawsuit-against-founder",
    "fullContent": "The DAO previously proposed a lawsuit against Azuki creator Zagabond over a dilutive $39 million NFT minting that took place in June.\nUpdate - November 25 11:45 AM UTC: This article was updated after receiving a clarification statement from an Azuki DAO spokesperson regarding its token distribution plan. Azuki DAO, an unofficial community decentralized autonomous organization surrounding the namesake nonfungible token collection, has announced its rebranding to “Bean\" as it drops a proposed lawsuit against the NFT collection’s founder, Zagabond, over a $39 million minting affair. In a statement sent to Cointelegraph, Azuki developers said the DAO will rebrand into a memecoin project and become part of the Ethereum layer-2 Blast ecosystem. Developers also claims that Bean has also secured $10 million from “prominent investors” for its development and acceleration within the Blast ecosystem. The proposed Bean memecoin will have a total supply of 1 billion. In a follow-up statement sent to Cointelegraph, Azuki DAO developers said that the current token supply plan displayed on its website is \"out of date.\" The plan previously states that 40% percent of tokens are allocated to its treasury, 50% to Azuki DAO members, and 10% to Azuki NFT creator Zagabond. The plan also previously stated that minting would only available to Azuki NFT holders, who must do so within 24 hours of the token’s launch or face “token burn.” The follow-up statement explains that \"50% of the $Bean [token] was allocated to the Azuki DAO community for the airdrop of Azuki series NFTs,\" which concluded four months ago. \"The remaining tokens are still in the address,\" they said. \"40% of $Bean [token] was allocated to the Bean Treasury, and 10% of $Bean was allocated to Zagabond, which is currently still in the address.\" The Azuki NFT collection represents 10,000 anime-themed profile pictures (PFPs). In June, a second series of 10,000 PFPs in the Azuki collection, dubbed “Elementals,” was released by Zagabond. Immediately after release, however, users noticed the close resemblance of Elemental PFPs to Azuki PFPs, thereby leading to the dilution of the latter through an increase in supply. The price of Azuki NFTs reportedly fell 44% in the immediate aftermath of Elementals’ release. The move also triggered a community lawsuit proposal launched by Azuki DAO against creator Zagabond. “Detailed information on financing and a roadmap for future developments will be disclosed shortly,” developers wrote.

In a Nov. 24 social media post, the team said it would sell the NFTs in three batches. The first batch will be auctioned from Nov. 27 to 28, the second from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4, and the third from Dec. 2 to 3. Symbiogenesis is Square Enix’s upcoming blockchain game that features Ethereum-based NFTs. Starting next week, it\u0027s finally time for the start of the auction! Phase 1: 11/27 12:00 - 11/28 11:59 (JST) Phase 2: 11/30 12:00 - 12/1 11:59 (JST) Phase 3: 12/2 12:00 - 12/3 11:59 (JST) More details herehttps://t.co/MFprrApwio#SYMBIOGENESIS According to the game’s documents, the first phase will include facet and mesh characters and will only allow “stakeholders” to participate. This seems to imply that only early investors will be able to participate in the Nov. 27–28 phase. The second and third phases will be available to participants in an “allowlist entry campaign,” the documents state. The game’s team ran the allowlist entry campaign from Nov. 7 to 21. Collectors were asked to participate in a series of quizzes, as well as a “treasure hunt” that took place within a prototype version of the Symbiogenesis game world. The participants earned NFT “relics” as a result of these activities, and they scored points toward participating in phase 2. The top 50 highest scores will be allowed to acquire NFTs in phase 2, as well as 40 random participants ranked 51st to 300th. The rest of the participants will be allowed to bid on items in phase 3. Square Enix describes Symbiogenesis as a “narrative-unlocked NFT entertainment” game. It is scheduled to be launched on Dec 21. Square Enix is the creator of the Final Fantasy series of games, which the company claims has sold over 173 million units. It launched Final Fantasy NFT trading cards on March 31. In April, the company announced it was partnering with Web3 infrastructure provider Elixir, although details of the partnership have been scarce.",

    "fullContent": "CoinGecko has acquired the NFT data infrastructure platform Zash as the firm remains bullish about the NFT market. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed.\nMajor cryptocurrency tracking website CoinGecko is scaling its data offering by acquiring the nonfungible token (NFT) data infrastructure platform Zash. CoinGecko plans to integrate Zash’s NFT data into its application programming interface (API) by the second quarter of 2024, the firm announced on Nov. 21, though the deal terms have not been disclosed. “API users will be able to enjoy a unified crypto data offering, where they can access fungible and nonfungible token data seamlessly and enjoy enriched crypto market insights,” CoinGecko co-founder and chief operating officer Bobby Ong told Cointelegraph. According to the exec, front-end users of CoinGecko’s web and mobile app will also be able to access the on-chain NFT data through the NFT floor price tracker next year. CoinGecko didn’t disclose the cost of the Zash acquisition to Cointelegraph. Founded in 2021, Zash operates an enterprise-grade NFT indexer and API, allowing users to track NFT data across 87 unique marketplaces — or a total of 102 marketplaces — like the major NFT exchange OpenSea. “Zash’s data also encompasses secondary sales, bundled trades, converts settlement in 12 currencies and encompass ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards,” Ong noted, adding that Zash’s coverage is “over four times more than alternatives.” Related: Crypto exchange Bullish buys 100% stake in crypto media site CoinDesk: Report CoinGecko’s latest move into the NFT market comes despite a significant decline in the NFT market, which is sometimes interpreted as a signal the NFT technology is maturing rather than a sign of distress.

    "title": "How can NFTs help farmers — from production to distribution?",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-can-nfts-help-farmers-from-production-to-distribution",
    "fullContent": "From avocado trees to blockchain, learn what utility NFTs are and how they’re reshaping the agricultural industry.\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) have traditionally been associated with digital art, profile pictures and other digital collectibles. Capable of preserving uniqueness, these tokens are still popular, but there is another type of NFTs that goes one step further — NFTs. They offer tangible and real-world benefits to holders. Utility NFTs offer immediate value upon purchase by granting access to certain privileges or exclusive experiences. For example, they can unlock premium content, provide memberships, or allow holders to redeem rewards or items. The value of the utility NFT most often derives from the value of the real-world item or experience it represents. However, it can also have intrinsic value based on rarity and popularity. Technically, utility NFTs are no different than regular NFTs — they leverage blockchain technology to ensure uniqueness, ownership and authenticity. The only difference is that they are directly linked to specific items or experiences. They are minted on decentralized networks using smart contract standards explicitly developed for NFTs. Utility NFTs are industry-agnostic, meaning they do not specialize in a specific industry and can transform many sectors and experiences, from gaming and fashion to live concerts and real estate. While it may be surprising, agriculture can also integrate these NFTs for various use cases to bring efficiency and transparency. NFTs can revolutionize the agricultural industry by providing a more transparent, efficient, and secure way to manage the supply chain. They, like digital crop certificates, can track ownership and authenticity throughout the supply chain, from farm to consumer, and can be used to digitize and manage physical assets relating to crops, livestock, and land. This can enhance transparency, improve efficiency, and unlock new possibilities for financing, trading, and insurance in the agricultural sector. One area where NFTs can have a huge impact is supply-chain management. NFTs and their underlying blockchain technology can certify the ownership and authenticity of assets, which makes these tokens suitable for the tracking of agricultural products. The main difference between utility NFTs and current traceability methods is that NFTs can be traced back to the individual farm or crop where the product came from. As the NFT moves along the supply chain, all the important information about the product is always available and can be checked, making sure that the product meets all the standards from the farm to the store. An ecosystem can mint NFTs for every stage of the supply chain, from the farm to the store. This would enable stakeholders and end users to verify where a food product came from and how it reached the market’s shelf. Utility NFTs, in this case, can grant stakeholders ownership rights over certain food products. These rights are essential for a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable food system. They empower farmers by granting them ownership of their produce, leading to fairer profits and improved livelihoods. This transparency extends to consumers, who can make informed choices about their food. Moreover, stakeholder ownership incentivizes farmers to produce high-quality food and reduces food waste by enabling direct sales to consumers. NFTs and blockchains are all about decentralization, transparency, proof of ownership and security. These features come to address several challenges in agriculture, an industry that still uses many old-school methods to grow and distribute food and goods. This reflects on the quality, efficiency and costs of production, eventually affecting the profitability of farmers and other stakeholders. Thanks to NFTs, stakeholders can create a secure, immutable record on the blockchain, enabling access to real-time data related to the entire supply chain of agricultural products. This unmatched level of transparency helps prevent fraud, ensures food safety and improves the implementation of sustainability practices. By bringing efficiency to all supply chain stages, NFT implementation can cut costs and have a positive impact on profitability. The integration of utility NFTs into supply-chain processes and other use cases can be a win-win for both farmers and consumers. One example of how NFTs can help the agricultural sector is illustrated by Dimitra, a leading blockchain-based enterprise system for AgTech driving productive, intelligent and inclusive farming. Dimitra helps farmers reduce efforts and improve efficiency by integrating its technology stack, including blockchain, mobile, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), drones and satellites. Dimitra’s utility NFTs offer innovative solutions for the agricultural sector, enabling farmers to secure financing, establish direct consumer connections, and monetize valuable data to make smarter decisions. This approach aims to streamline financing processes, promote transparency and fair pricing, and provide farmers with additional revenue opportunities. Despite their benefits and potential, farmers and consumers should be aware of certain limitations of NFTs and blockchain technology in general. To begin with, blockchains are closed systems without access to real-world data. Therefore, connecting an on-chain NFT with a physical or digital off-chain asset requires additional effort. This can be achieved with the help of so-called oracles or other conditions embedded into the smart contract itself. Eventually, stakeholders must ensure that the tokens accurately represent the underlying products, be it crops, livestock or bonds. For example, Dimitra has developed its Land Suitability Oracle that evaluates each farm based on its potential to grow a particular crop. Moreover, Dimitra already has an application that assesses farmer performance. The combination of these tools provides a significant capability for agricultural lenders compared to the available tools. NFTs can be used independently or with other blockchain applications to improve supply-chain management at all stages. For example, Dimitra is revolutionizing farming with utility NFTs, starting with avocados. The company has recently launched an NFT series in collaboration with One Million Avocados, a Kenya-based startup. These NFTs enable individuals to sponsor avocado trees for $50, providing farmers with essential resources like seedlings and fertilizers as well as digital platform access and sensors. Dimitra is also developing a Crop Certificate program where, through a Web3 interface, investors provide a loan through a regulated crowdfunding process and get premiums repaid from the proceeds of the crop harvest.  Source: Dimitra This unique approach improves security, combating avocado theft in Africa. Unlike traditional loans, which are challenging for avocado farmers due to the crop’s long maturation period. As the trees grow, investors share in the rewards. In the second year, an avocado tree may produce one fruit, but by the tenth, it can yield 300 to 400 kg (661–881 lbs), and considering today’s export prices, farmers can earn three times more than the domestic markets. What’s more, they don’t need to pay premiums on loans before generating revenue. Dimitra’s NFT launch begins with 1,000 avocado trees as a pilot in the fall of 2023, with plans to expand into mangoes, cocoa and other crops. By implementing blockchain and NFTs, Dimitra empowers farmers, investors and philanthropic sponsors in AgTech, demonstrating the transformative potential of this technology in agriculture.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/free-to-play-web3-games-mass-adoption-ygg-gabby-dizon",
    "fullContent": "Gabby Dizon, the co-founder of Yield Guild Games, says a renewed focus on free-to-play gaming will help boost Web3 game adoption.\n2024’s most successful Web3 games will pivot from play-to-earn (P2E) to instead focus on being entirely free-to-play to attract players, says Yield Guild Games co-founder Gabby Dizon. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Dizon said unlike games such as Axie Infinity Classic — which require players to purchase at least three Axie nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to play — the new wave of hyper-successful Web3 games will seek to remove as many of the financial and technical barriers to entry as possible. “There’s an evolution of the business model where the games are free to play, and then at some point along the way while you’re playing, then you’re able to mint an NFT or start earning tokens, but a lot of new games aren’t really starting with requiring NFT ownership at the start,” he said. This shift toward a free-to-play model is part of a wider effort from Web3 game developers to put gameplay first and tokenomics second, Dizon explained. He added the shift forms a large part of the solution to speculative Web3 gaming bubbles. By creating games that players want to keep playing, they’ll reinvest their capital in the game and prevent the in-game economy from becoming a cash-generating machine, Dizon said. Running near-parallel to the decline in crypto prices, blockchain games witnessed their own downturn as players and revenues trickled out of the ecosystem following the sudden collapse in Axie Infinity-related asset values in late 2021. Surveys from October 2022 showed that even the most adamant crypto gamers were leaving in droves, citing the over-financialization of gameplay, lack of fun and confusion around crypto wallet tech. Dizon says all of that is about to change. “After Axie became popular two years ago, a lot of very experienced teams took a look at its rapid ascent and thought: ‘Now it’s a real industry, maybe I could do better by making my own game,’” he said. For the past 18 months, Dizon and other Web3 gaming industry leaders have eagerly awaited the launch of a series of new Web3 games in the fourth quarter of 2023, such as the Nov. 16 open beta Epic Games store launch of the blockchain-based trading card game Parallel. PRIME time is almost here. https://t.co/fXBVvboxx6 “Expect to see lots of really high-quality games, with high-quality teams behind them, as well as new experiments in tokenomics and earning models,” he said. Related: Blockchain game Illuvium goes mainstream with looming Epic Games Store listing Dizon pointed to the introduction of the ERC-6551 token standard or “token bound” accounts in gaming as a reason to be excited about blockchain-based games in the future, as some developers are using it to thread artificial intelligence (AI) into games. “You can actually start attaching AI behaviors to your avatar, and you can give it instructions: ‘I want you to go out to the world, craft me a gun, kill some monsters and then bring the treasure back,’ Dizon said. “Then, a few hours later, you can check the wallet that’s embedded in it, and it’s like, oh, I got these things back.” Dizon believes this kind of automation will greatly reduce the amount of “grinding” needed in games, allowing players to jump in for the fun parts while leaving the boring stuff to AI. “I think it’s going to be the start of a new game genre of you interacting with AI and not having to play the game all day,” he said. “You set parameters for the AI and just let it do things in the game world.” Magazine: Asia Express: No civil protection for crypto in China, $300K to list coins in Hong Kong?",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-nft-dapps-and-how-to-create-and-launch-one",
    "fullContent": "Explore the evolving world of NFT DApps: decentralized, blockchain-powered applications revolutionizing digital ownership and creative monetization.\nThe synergy between NFTs and DApps creates a dynamic ecosystem where digital ownership, decentralized finance and programmable assets converge, offering innovative solutions across various industries. Decentralized applications (DApps) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are two important components of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems. Despite their disparate functions, there are several instances in which they coincide and enhance one another. For instance, NFTs can be used in DApps to signify ownership or access privileges for both real and digital assets. DApps can tokenize unique goods, such as in-game assets, digital art or real estate, by utilizing NFT standards such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155. NFTs are frequently used to represent in-game assets in gaming DApps. These assets are tradeable and buyable on secondary markets, which improves the idea of genuine ownership and compatibility across many virtual worlds or games. Moreover, DApps built specifically to create, manage and trade digital valuables have become popular due to the rise of NFTs. Tokenizing their creations allows artists and content creators to produce one-of-a-kind digital assets that consumers can purchase, sell and own. This has given creators new opportunities to interact directly with their audience while providing collectors with a safe and verifiable method of obtaining digital asset ownership. The programmable nature of smart contracts reinforces the convergence between DApps and NFTs. Smart contracts can be used by DApps to automate a number of NFT-related tasks, including content licensing, royalty distribution and even the implementation of dynamic features inside the NFT itself. The increased programmability of NFTs in decentralized applications improves their usefulness and functionality. Related: The different types of NFTs: A beginner’s guide Blockchain-based applications that integrate nonfungible tokens are known as NFT DApps. Using such apps, users can create, purchase, sell and trade original digital products, such as artwork, collectibles and in-game items. NFT DApps empower gamers, artists and content creators by utilizing the transparency and security of blockchain technology to transform ownership. The importance of NFT DApps lies in providing a decentralized marketplace, fostering peer-to-peer transactions, introducing innovative ownership forms, disrupting established sectors and democratizing access to the global digital economy. NFT DApps encompass a diverse range of platforms, each tailored to different facets of the digital and blockchain landscape. Artists tokenize their works as NFTs on platforms like OpenSea and Rarible, which act as marketplaces for people to purchase, sell and exchange their original digital assets. As centers of the emerging digital art scene, these platforms enable artists to claim ownership and value within the blockchain ecosystem. NFTs are used by DApps such as Decentraland and CryptoKitties to represent in-game objects, characters or items. These assets can be bought, sold and traded, creating a thriving virtual economy. The convergence of blockchain technology with gaming has resulted in the development of innovative concepts like play-to-earn, which allows users to earn money by engaging in blockchain-based games. Platforms for virtual real estate give NFTs a distinctive spin. In addition to developing and making money off of their virtual real estate, users can buy, sell and trade virtual land and property. This novel idea has sparked interest in user-owned, decentralized virtual worlds and raised the possibility of a new era in digital property rights. Marketplaces like Foundation and Mintable are an essential part of the NFT ecosystem, which provide artists and producers with the means to mint their NFTs and present them to a worldwide audience. These platforms act as intermediaries, bringing together creators and fans and fostering the general expansion of the NFT industry. In addition to the creative realm, NFTs have found applications in DeFi. DApps like Aavegotchi and Rarible explore the integration of NFTs as collateral within DeFi protocols. By allowing users to lend or borrow funds depending on the value of their NFT holdings, this innovative use case opens up new possibilities at the nexus of digital ownership and decentralized finance. Creating an NFT DApp involves a series of steps, as explained below: It is imperative that the team thoroughly establish the NFT DApp’s concept before beginning development. This entails describing the goal, intended user base and distinctive characteristics that will make the DApp stand out in the crowded NFT market. For developing an NFT DApp, choosing the right blockchain platform is a prerequisite. With its well-established infrastructure and broad support for NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155, Ethereum is a well-liked choice. Alternatively, other blockchain platforms, such as BNB Smart Chain, may be considered based on specific project requirements. Install the required dependencies and tools to set up the development environment. This covers smart contract development kits, blockchain development frameworks and any additional tools needed for testing and scripting. Create the smart contracts that will govern the distribution, creation and ownership of NFTs. The terms and features of the NFTs, including minting, purchasing, selling and transferring, are outlined in these contracts. Integrate wallets to allow users to safely handle their NFTs. To enable users to engage with the DApp via their cryptocurrency wallets, this entails connecting with wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Develop the minting feature so that creators can tokenize their assets with NFTs. Developers need to design an intuitive user interface (UI) for creators and artists to easily upload their work, add metadata, and mint NFTs on the blockchain. This ensures a user-friendly platform navigation experience. Additionally, implement features for purchasing, selling and trading NFTs if the NFT DApp includes a marketplace. Incorporate features such as auctioning, bidding and real-time pricing adjustments. Users should be able to browse, purchase and sell NFTs with ease due to a user-friendly, entertaining UI. Consider adding functions such as filters, search and an easy-to-use wallet interface. Before deploying the NFT DApp to the blockchain, ensure the NFT DApp is thoroughly tested to find and fix any flaws or vulnerabilities. When satisfied, deploy the related files and smart contracts on the selected blockchain. This entails engaging with the blockchain network to enable global user accessibility for the NFT DApp. A strategic strategy is needed when launching an NFT DApp to spark interest and ensure a smooth launch into the market. Start by releasing well-crafted smart contracts over the mainnet to officially launch the NFT DApp. Plan a thorough marketing strategy at the same time to increase exposure. Create a captivating story that highlights the special value proposition of the NFT DApp and share it via a variety of platforms, such as forums, social media sites and cryptocurrency communities. To grow your audience and establish credibility, get in touch with influential people and thought leaders in the NFT industry. Establish a well-thought-out website that functions as a central information center and has guidelines and user-friendly interfaces to help new users get the hang of the platform. During the launch phase, it is imperative to implement a robust community feedback loop to resolve user complaints swiftly and promote a pleasant community climate. Following the launch, the team must implement an open line of communication with users, respond to their issues, and modify the DApp to adjust to changing market dynamics. Developing and launching an NFT DApp present myriad challenges. The main obstacle is technical scalability because of the growing demand and complexity of NFT transactions. It becomes imperative to ensure a smooth and effective user experience, necessitating creative solutions to deal with possible network congestion and sluggish transaction processing times. Security for smart contracts is crucial since flaws might have permanent effects on users and NFTs’ integrity. In addition, it can be difficult to stand out in a saturated market where several NFT DApps are competing for users’ attention. Another level of complexity is navigating legal ambiguities, particularly when it comes to intellectual property rights and regulatory compliance. To overcome these challenges, a careful fusion of technological know-how, security protocols, user-centered design and an acute awareness of the changing regulatory environment around NFTs is required.",

    "title": "New York MoMA now has tokenized artworks in its permanent collection",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-moma-token-art-nfts",
    "fullContent": "The museum’s acquisition of two NFTs marked its first on-chain and AI holdings.\nGenerative art is proving Web3’s creative anchor in the traditional art world. Last month, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) made headlines by acquiring Refik Anadol’s “Unsupervised — Machine Hallucinations” (2022) alongside an edition from last year’s “3FACE” project by Ian Cheng. These two mark the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) and nonfungible token (NFT) additions to MoMA’s collection, already home to relics such as Andy Warhol’s soup cans and Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.” The landmark acquisitions also supplement MoMA’s longtime legacy of pioneering exhibitions at the intersection of technology and art, from its 1968 show “The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age” through this year’s “Signals: How Video Transformed the World.” MoMA’s announcement arrived in tandem with an outline of the institution’s digital art programming for the fall and winter seasons ahead, including the debut of video artist Leslie Thornton’s latest work, “HANDMADE” (2023), and an online exhibition with Feral File opening early next year. Weeks before, MoMA had announced its on-chain Postcard project, too. “These new initiatives underscore MoMA’s longstanding commitment to support artists who experiment with emerging technologies to expand their visual vocabularies and creative exploration, increase the impact of their work and help us understand and navigate transformative change in the world,” the Museum’s release around their acquisitions states. “I’m very proud to be included,” Cheng told Cointelegraph. “MoMA had previously acquired my ‘Emissaries’ trilogy of simulations in 2017. Their openness and enthusiasm for acquiring dynamic digital art is rare for an institution.” It’s the screensaver heard around the world. Whether you’re enamored or suspicious of this one-time Google artist-in-residence’s prolific and mesmerizing machine-learning abstractions, the odds are you’ve seen them. Anadol designed this one in particular with help from Nvidia. It feeds 138,151 pieces of visual metadata from MoMA’s collection to an algorithm that produces an AI imagination of art history through Anadol’s signature undulations. Since its release in November 2022, “Unsupervised” has been reviewed by critics at Vulture, Artforum and more. The time it took to write those reviews says more than anything about the work’s import. Jerry Saltz’s half-baked hot takes don’t detract from the mental energy his writing requires. Haters alone haven’t made Anadol famous — he has scores of devoted fans if not collectors. MoMA opted to extend the work’s 24-foot tall display several times. It just came down on Oct. 29, but visitors who minted their proof-of-attendance protocol, or POAP, from the posted QR code still have a piece of the spectacle. Noted NFT collector and founder of the club 1 OF 1 Ryan Zurrer made the work’s acquisition possible, along with the “RFC Collection,” led by Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile and Desiree Casoni. “I tip my hat to the folks at MoMA for understanding the cultural zeitgeist of the moment,” Zurrer told ARTnews. “Unsupervised went up two weeks before ChatGPT went public. AI is the defining topic of the moment, and MoMA captured that. I’m excited to donate this work to MoMA. But I need to acknowledge that this isn’t just a donation from me and [collector] Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, but from Refik. He is bringing the servers and screens and the other components. The NFT is one part of this conceptual artwork that belongs to MoMA now.” While the Museum couldn’t clarify whether Anadol outright donated the hardware that enabled “Unsupervised” to go on view, we can assume that’s the case. Their release said Thornton’s “HANDMADE” will go on view in the same Gund Lobby where they displayed “Unsupervised” on a screen the very same size, “designed by and realized with thanks to Refik Anadol Studio.” Meanwhile, Cheng evades branding. A lifelong exploration of psychology through cutting-edge technologies defines his practice more than any single aesthetic. In fact, there are 4,096 unique editions of “3FACE” in existence, and not one of them was designed explicitly by Cheng’s hand. Works in the generative project depict adaptive, ongoing visual portraits of their owners, crafted using data gleaned from their wallets at any given moment. MoMA calls it his “most ambitious experimental artwork to date to explore blockchain technologies and the decentralization of data,” which expands upon “the artist’s interest in the capacity of humans to relate to change.” In his efforts to represent and shape the ephemeral mind, Cheng told Right Click Save last year he believes “art can play a role in upgrading the unconscious response we have to complexity.” “3FACE” honors the depths of every person — and, because it’s dynamic, their ability to change. The NFT platform Outland Art donated its “3FACE” to MoMA’s collection. “Jason Li and Chris Lew advised a lot and helped flesh out the team to turn the idea into a reality,” Cheng told Cointelegraph. “I would not have made ‘3FACE’ without Outland.” The work’s public entry on MoMA’s website doesn’t list what number out of the whole series it is or what wallet it belongs to. MoMA didn’t respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment, but based on the way “3FACE” works and the fact that MoMA just started collecting on-chain artworks, this might be the “3FACE” interpretation of a wide open wallet populated only by Anadol’s “Unsupervised.” Carrying the torch from former contentious and pioneering art forms like photography, generative art has forced this generation of artists to reassess what exactly makes art valuable. “The endgame of generative AI tooling is a new immediacy between thought and visual articulation,” Cheng mused about what’s next for AI art. “We’re used to the immediacy between thought and written or verbal expression. A writer, with no intermediary help, can construct a novel. Imagine if you, with no intermediary help, could construct a movie. As with writing fiction, the filmmaker is capped only by their own imagination, their taste, the quality of their questions, their courage to pursue gray truths, and their understanding of human behavior.” Technology will continually evolve, but it’s the evolution of artists’ abilities in using it that divides what’s merely eye-catching from what’s impactful. Not that those two are mutually exclusive — even though MoMA’s Anadol acquisition is akin to the institution buying itself a Louis Vuitton bag, what society calls luxury is history on its own. Anadol and Cheng both work predominantly with data while making AI art. The emergent properties of their processes have implications. “Unsupervised” begs the question: What is art history? — a fraught topic traditional art historians argue over without even breaching painting alone. By virtue of its premise, “3FACE” asks those who engage with it how they’d quantify a gnarled human psyche. It’s one of the few projects that uses the ledger as anything more than a manner of transacting. Museums such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Centre Pompidou started collecting NFTs back in the boom days. MoMA’s decision to lend credence to such works now marks a new watershed moment. “We pinch our nose at ‘AI art’ right now because the first experiments look like experiments, but zoom out 10 years from now,” Cheng said. “The ease of producing visually refined expression will unlock a lot of artistic agency from a greater plurality of people, and this is a good thing.”",

According to a press release seen by Cointelegraph, the “Ice and Snow Season” themed pop-up store is scheduled to run from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31 and will feature a variety of co-branded merchandise, such as a Dairy Queen-WGG themed ice cream. In addition, WGG NFT holders will receive exclusive perks as part of the joint venture. The project has a large following among users in the Asia-Pacific region. “Beyond merely showcasing Dairy Queen’s ongoing efforts in new media digital marketing, this collaboration also serves to offer consumers a more nuanced understanding of the NFT art IP, WGG, resulting in enhanced experiences and connections,” the release states. The WGG collection features 5,555 “Lil Ghosts” NFTs created by Hong Kong Web3 holding company ManesLab in 2021. The collection has surpassed 21,510 Ether (ETH) ($43.5 million) in trading volume since inception. Its current floor price is 0.485 ETH ($995.2). In September, WGG launched the “City Party Map - Shanghai Station” event with local food retailer Jiujiu Duck Neck to offer discounts for NFT holders at more than 500 of its retail stores. Last month, the project announced the “Ghost Season” event at Beijing’s affluent shopping hub The Box, displaying its NFT art on 3D screens for shoppers. Amid a severe crypto winter, many NFT projects have turned to partnerships with Web2 or even traditional brick-and-mortar firms for marketing collaboration. In March, the Wassies by Wassies NFT Collection opened a namesake pop-up hotel in Singapore. The hotel ran until September and offered Wassie-themed rooms for around $100 per night.",

    "fullContent": "OpenSea users have reportedly been targeted with a widespread email phishing campaign, including a fake developer API risk alert and a fake NFT offer.\nUsers of the major nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea have said they are being targeted with a new email phishing attack and have received emails containing malicious links from attackers posing as the marketplace. According to social media reports, OpenSea users and developers have been targeted by various email phishing campaigns, including a fake developer account risk alert and a fake NFT offer. One OpenSea developer took to X (formerly Twitter) on Nov. 13 to report receiving a phishing attempt at an email strictly dedicated to their OpenSea Application Programming Interface (API) key. “In other words, dev contacts have been exfiltrated from OpenSea and are the real target in this campaign,” the post read. The social media report came in response to OpenSea’s insistence that the platform has not been hacked and urging users not to click on links they don’t trust. Correct- there is no smart contract vuln. But unfortunately for @opensea I just received a phishing attempt, to an email that was strictly dedicated to my OpenSea API key. In other words, dev contacts have been exfiltrated from OpenSea and are the real target in this campaign https://t.co/GD4UgwWIrx pic.twitter.com/rtyUJBMlwl Another OpenSea user took to Reddit to express confusion about the ongoing phishing campaign on Nov. 14. “Haven’t used OpenSea for years and all of a sudden, I keep getting emails talking about my NFT listings getting offers,” the poster wrote, adding that all the vulnerable links were trying to direct the reader to install a malicious app. “Right now I’m getting 3-4 scam/phishing emails a day which is crazy since I got zero just a few weeks ago,” the Redditor wrote, adding: The news comes a few weeks after one of OpenSea’s third-party vendors experienced a security incident that exposed information related to user API keys. OpenSea reported the breach in a notification email to affected users in late September 2023, stating that user emails and developer API keys may have been leaked due to the attack. Choose your third party well… Opensea posted that a vendor was attacked, resulting in the leak of developers\u0027 API keys! Get advice from a professional security consultant about the safety of the third party before choosing. E.g. @SlowMist_Team pic.twitter.com/jcBJ9IaAEN OpenSea users have received phishing emails previously. In February 2022, OpenSea officially confirmed that its platform faced a phishing attack from outside the OpenSea website and urged users to stay away from clicking on any links in the emails. The firm was also investigating rumors of an exploit associated with OpenSea-related smart contracts. Related: Chinese hackers use fake Skype app to target crypto users in new phishing scam OpenSea did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. This latest phishing campaign is happening just after OpenSea laid off 50% of its staff, with the stated intention of launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team. This attack is yet another reminder for the cryptocurrency community to stay vigilant when receiving emails from service providers. To avoid a phishing hack, users should be cautious of the email sender’s authenticity and the associated links. Users should also remember that crypto firms never ask their users for personal data like wallet addresses or private keys.

In a Nov. 14 statement, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York said French national Aurelien Michel pleaded guilty to executing a “rug pull” and admitted to defrauding investors out of $3 million in connection with the fraudulent Mutant Ape Planet NFTs. Nonfungible Token (NFT) Developer Pleads Guilty to an International Scheme to Defraud NFT Purchasers Aurelien Michel Conspired to Steal From Purchasers of “Mutant Ape Planet” NFTs Through False Promises and Misrepresentations@HSINewYork @IRSCI_NY https://t.co/K3CzIb8dQD According to Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors, Michel and his co-conspirators marketed the NFTs to investors by falsely promising them rewards and benefits designed to increase the demand for the collection. Prosecutors said Michel and his associates “intentionally failed to deliver on these promises, diverting millions of dollars’ worth of proceeds for their personal benefit.” “While Michel purported to sell dream NFTs backed with rewards and benefits, he defrauded investors, turning their dream into a nightmare of deception and losses,” said Thomas M. Fattorusso, special agent in charge of the Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation in New York. Michel was arrested in New York on Jan. 4, 2023, on charges related to the scheme. The DOJ said on Jan. 5 that Michel admitted to the NFT collection’s community via a social media chat that he perpetrated a rug pull and said, “We never intended to rug but the community went way too toxic.” Upon sentencing, Michel faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and has agreed to pay $1.4 million in restitution.

In February 2022, it boasted more than 320 Ether (ETH) in sales volume, which dropped significantly by April 2022, two months later. By January 2023, around the time of Michel’s arrest, the average price and total sales volume of the collection had cratered to near zero. Magazine: I spent a week working in VR.

    "fullContent": "The NFT platform, dubbed Disney Pinnacle, will go live later this year.\nDisney has created a nonfungible token (NFT) platform together with blockchain and metaverse firm Dapper Labs. According to the Nov. 14 announcement, Disney will tokenize its iconic cartoon characters from the past century onto its NFT marketplace, dubbed Disney Pinnacle. The platform will also include icons from Pixar as well as heroes and villains from the Star Wars galaxy, uniquely styled as collectible and tradable digital pins. “Fans anywhere will be able to collect dynamic pins on their phone and trade instantly and securely with each other no matter where they are in the world,\" Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou explained. The NFT platform will launch later this year on the Apple App Store for iOS, the Google Play Store for Android and on the web. Currently, only a waitlist and a landing site exist on its official page. Disney Pinnacle is built on layer-1 blockchain Flow, which Dapper Labs also created. Previously, Ticketmaster elected to mint NFT event tickets on the Flow blockchain. Earlier this year, Disney pulled the plug on its metaverse division as part of a broader restructuring plan to cut its operating expenses by $5.5 billion and lay off 7,000 staff over two months. The metaverse division’s 50 or so members were left without a new employment contract. Founded in Vancouver, Canada in 2018, Dapper Labs received a $15 million investment from Hong Kong Web3 creator Animoca Brands. In July 2023, Dapper Labs announced its third round of staff layoffs year-to-date. The firm is known for its NFT brands such as CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot.",

    "fullContent": "Animoca Brands will become a validator for the Chiliz Chain as the venture capital firm looks to capitalize on the SportFi ecosystem.\nVenture capital firm Animoca Brands will put its weight behind fan token blockchain Chiliz Chain as it joins the network as a validator within its proof-of-stake authority protocol. Chiliz Chain is the backbone of Socios.com, the platform that operates a plethora of fan tokens for some of the biggest global football and sports teams. Europe’s most loved football clubs and a number of household sports brands have tapped into the solution to power Web3 fan tokens and other blockchain-based offerings. Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu says the partnership presents an opportunity for his firm to combine its expertise in nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming with Chiliz’s focus on sports and entertainment-focused blockchain solutions. Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus adds that Animoca’s addition as a network validator marks a pivotal point in the firm’s history as it looks to solidify its position as a major blockchain solution primarily focused on catalyzing Web3 functionality and the wider sports industry. Animoca Brands becomes the latest validator of the Chiliz Chain, joining the likes of Ankr, Paribu, Meria, Luganoes and InfStones as validators. Similar to proof-of-stake blockchain protocols like Ethereum, validators authorize and enable the creation of fan tokens, NFTs and decentralized applications, as well as verifying transactions and executing smart contracts. Animoca has a wide-ranging spread of investments across the Web3 space and has also honed its focus on the sports sector. Its Web3 sports products include One Fight Arena, AFL Mint and REVV Motorsport. The latter includes the likes of MotoGP Ignition, MotoGP Guru, Formula E: High Voltage, REVV Racing and Torque Drift. Animoca grabbed headlines in April 2022 by acquiring French racing game developer Eden Games for $15.3 million. The deal aimed to acquire racing game development talent to enhance the REVV Motorsport ecosystem and introduce blockchain-based games focused on the genre. Chiliz launched its own layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain ecosystem to support its growth in Feb. 2023. The launch marked the transition away from its Ethereum-based ERC-20 token ecosystem to its own blockchain solution. The blockchain initially used a system of 11 active validators with proof-of-stake authority consensus, which is touted to provide faster block times, lower fees and energy usage.",

    "fullContent": "CoinW executive Sonia Shaw told Cointelegraph that the recent uptick in NFT sales shows a “broader and more profound interest” extending beyond art.\nIn the weeks leading up to November, nonfungible token (NFT) data showed a consistent upward leap in weekly sales. While the volume is still far from its peak in 2021, executives in the industry believe the upward trend will likely continue. On Nov. 6, data published by blockchain analytics firm Nansen showed that NFT sales volume leaped from $56 million in the week ending on Oct. 9 to $129 million in the week ending on Nov. 6. According to Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of NFT marketplace SuperRare, this trend will likely continue in the coming months. The executive believes that the worst has passed and is expecting upward swings shortly. He said: Perkins also believes that the downturn in NFTs was “purely sentiment.” The SuperRare co-founder told Cointelegraph in a statement that in the past 18 months, nothing “inherently went wrong” with NFTs. “NFTs are a fundamental advancement in the internet because they introduce traceable origin and ownership to digital objects. This unlocks a new online creator economy that can be 100x bigger than Web2,” he added. The executive also believes that in the long term, NFTs will be a big part of the online economy, and the space will see volumes that “eclipse those of the last cycle.” Commenting on the topic, Sonia Shaw, partner and vice president of partnership at digital asset exchange CoinW, said that the recent growth in NFT sales reflects a “broader and more profound interest” that extends beyond art and collectibles. Shaw told Cointelegraph that NFTs represent a significant shift in digital and physical asset management. She explained: Shaw also highlighted that potential use cases for NFTs could revolutionize industries such as identity management, real estate, healthcare, finance and supply chain logistics. While the executive believes in the role of NFTs in advancing digital ownership, Shaw also told Cointelegraph that it’s essential for players to also be mindful of the challenges. This includes regulatory considerations, environmental impact and security issues. Related: NFTs in the academy: Fighting fake credentials and unfair wages Meanwhile, Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of NFT platform Enjin, echoed the sentiments. Making a case for NFTs, Tan highlighted that NFTs have already been established as a unique digital asset class entirely separate from crypto. The executive also told Cointelegraph that many investors entering the digital asset space back in 2021 were interested primarily in NFTs. Furthermore, Tan also pointed out that NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki have “remained intact” despite the bear market. As more investors enter crypto, they may also eventually dive into NFTs. “Renewed interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum will necessarily spread to blue chip NFTs and newer collections, including gaming NFTs,” Tan added.

    "fullContent": "The survey was conducted at the request of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the spring of 2023.\nCryptocurrencies are the second most popular type of investment asset among the adult French population, according to a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published by France’s principal financial regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, on Nov. 13. According to the survey, 9.4% of the French population holds crypto assets, which is only marginally lower than those holding the most popular type of investment asset, real estate funds (10.7%). A further 2.8% of respondents possess nonfungible tokens. The survey also measured the group of “new investors” who have invested for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The new investors are mainly men (64%) and are significantly younger than traditional investors, with an average age of 36 versus 51 for the latter. In this category, 54% hold crypto assets. Related: French regulator sees DeFi as ‘disintermediated,’ not ‘decentralized’ The survey’s authors also noted that new individual investors have a “relatively low level of financial knowledge,” particularly those in the youngest group aged 18–24. They were more likely to give incorrect answers about the basics of investment strategy than traditional investors. The survey was conducted among 1,056 respondents in the spring of 2023, with 40 in-depth interviews about their needs and motivations. France is actively pursuing a leadership role in Europe in digital economy and innovations. In September, local telecommunications group Iliad revealed an investment of 100 million euros ($106 million) to fund the creation of an “excellence lab” dedicated to artificial intelligence research in Paris.

    "fullContent": "The Chinese government says theft of digital collections violates the protection law and interests of the crime of illegally obtaining computer information system data.\nThe Chinese government released a statement on Nov. 10 declaring that anyone stealing digital collections, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs), will be subject to theft sentences. It outlines three views on the type of crime that theft of digital collections falls under, the first two classifying it as either data or digital property. However, the statement stresses that the third view, which sees digital collections as both data and virtual property, would fall under the umbrella of “co-offending.” The statement explained that stealing a digital collection includes intrusion into the system on which it is housed, therefore also committing the crime of illegally obtaining computer information system data and theft. It elaborates on this topic, naming digital collections “network virtual property” and stressing that in the criminal law context, “collections should be recognized as property.” Related: 47 countries pledge to authorize the crypto-asset reporting framework by 2027 NFTs were specifically mentioned, establishing that digital collections are derived from the concept of NFTs “abroad” and use blockchain technology to “map specific assets” with “unique, non-copyable, tamper-preventing, and permanent storage characteristics.” The declaration said that, although China has not opened the “secondary flow market” for digital collections, “consumers can rely on trading platforms to complete purchases, collections, transfers, destruction and other operations to achieve exclusive possession, use, and disposal capabilities.” Despite China’s official ban from 2021 on nearly all crypto-related activity and transactions other than simply owning cryptocurrencies, there has been recent buzz surrounding NFTs. A local Chinese media outlet reported on Oct. 25 that the Alibaba-owned peer-to-peer marketplace Xianyu removed its censorship of “nonfungible tokens” and “digital asset” related keywords in its search. Prior to that, on Oct. 6 China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the Chinese government, announced that it wanted to create its own NFT platform and would award 2.813 million Chinese yuan ($390,000) to a third-party contractor to design the platform up to its specifications.

Following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call, Roblox founder and CEO Baszucki spoke about the role major influencers play in fueling the widespread adoption of NFTs and digital collectibles in a recent CNBC interview. He believes in the idea of users being able to move their collections across non-native platforms: For example, Baszucki stated that A-list celebrities such as Elton John could sign up on Roblox and make and sell limited edition collectibles like capes for charity. These types of collectibles could go off the Roblox platform as an NFT and could be sold in other marketplaces. “What we do expect is that creators, whether it’s Elton John or Nike or someone else making a digital item, that they would play a key role and have a fair amount of control in that process,” Baszucki concluded. Roblox’s latest earnings call revealed a loss in Q3; however, the company recorded a 20% year-over-year growth in booking estimates on higher in-game spending and the total number of users.

On Nov. 5, attendees began reporting eye and skin-related issues after attending ApeFest the day before — which was a free event for Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club owners held in Hong Kong. In a Nov. 9 X (Twitter) post, Yuga’s Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) account confirmed that “UV-A emitting lights installed in one corner of the event was likely the cause of the reported issues.” The BAYC said the determination came following a joint investigation with Jack Morton Worldwide, the agency that produced ApeFest, which conducted on-site inspections, testing, interviewed the events contractors and looked at equipment logs and specification sheets.

The United States National Eye Institute says UV light exposure can potentially increase the risk of eye problems. UVA lights, better known as blacklights, are used for different purposes depending on their wavelength. UVA lights with lower wavelengths are typically used for suntanning beds, while lights with wavelengths closer to the visible light spectrum are used for special effect lighting such as in nightclubs. The BAYC did not disclose specific details about the kind of UVA lights used at ApeFest.

The space has also received support from several influential people, including big names from outside of Web3. Two of those people are world-famous rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg and his son Cordell Broadus, also known as Champ Medici. Over the past year, Broadus and Snoop have been at the forefront of combining Web3 technologies like nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the metaverse and blockchain with the music industry and its large community. In November 2022, alongside his other Web3-related projects, Snoop Dogg partnered with Billy Ray Cyrus to bridge music communities across genres and blockchain networks with a music NFT drop. \"Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus are launching a hip-hop country single with the new Animal Concerts NFT drop\"$ANML #NFTs #Bullish Read more about this on @RaritySniperNFT ⬇️ https://t.co/SC4d5n2Pg4 Broadus has been an essential part of bringing his father’s legacy to life in this new era of digital innovation. Cointelegraph sat down with him to understand what goes into bringing a legacy artist and communities into the Web3 space. He explained that in 2020, he was introduced to the metaverse, and shortly after that, his father was approached by Crypto.com. When collaborators brought up digital assets and NFTs in the studio, he recalled that no one understood the concept well enough to take it seriously. Broadus said he wanted to be a “bridge” to bring people into this space so that they could learn how to digitize their business and not rely only on the methods of the past. He felt a lot of musicians didn’t realize the potential of their unreleased music being, in some ways, equivalent to digital assets. When it comes to Snoop himself, Broadus said that his father had to trust his judgment. He recalled urging Snoop “for years” to recreate his first album, Doggystyle, which was released in 1993 by Death Row Records. He explained that over time, he believed the idea of rereleasing music “just kind of got embedded in [Snoop’s] head, so when the [NFT] idea came, he was super receptive to it.” However, this was something he and his team understood more clearly after launching a pilot on OpenSea, where Broadus and his team released 250 Snoop songs and sold the stems and the license to those songs. 1149 minted on 4/20 Price now goes up with every new mint Come N get yours Let Me Hit Somethin is just getting started ‍♂️ https://t.co/YIBhFh5eOe Broadus and the team started by releasing 500 copies of the single “High” for $500 each. “That first day we sold out and made $250,000 from that first single. From there, it was the numbers, and the numbers don’t lie. Then we only did it for 30 days and by the last 30th day, altogether we did $3.5 million,” he recalled. Related: AI can be a ‘creative amplifier’ — Grammy chief exec Harvey Mason Jr. Broadus explained how he witnessed many creators buy those songs and stems and turn them into EDM and country songs. He said that type of collaboration and creativity wouldn’t have been possible without NFTs and called the experience “uplifting.” This became even more real for Broadus when he attended NFT NYC and experienced firsthand musicians who bought the NFT song stems from the pilot. “To be able to be out in public in New York and hear like five different artists show me their songs that they bought from our pilot program and just see how happy they were to be able to be on the song with Snoop and other Death Row artists was huge for me. That’s what touched me the most.” He also recalled a moment at an event by The Sandbox earlier in 2023 where he was in conversations with big “decision-makers” in Web2 and Web3 and realized the importance of their efforts and presence in the space for their wider community. “I wanted to make it a priority and take it upon myself to show not just my father but all of the culture and ensure they were in that room because there was no representation. I was probably one of the only black kids in that room, and I wanted to make sure that I could change that.” Snoop, Broadus and the team behind their endeavors in the space have continued to move with this momentum with their latest venture announced on Nov. 6, Death Row Games, named after the legendary Death Row Records, which Snoop acquired in February 2022. Death Row Games is building off a new legacy, which was in part constructed by the teams’ gaming-related presence in the Web3 space, including Snoop’s Snoopverse in The Sandbox metaverse and Dr. Bombay with Yuga Labs, among others. He is bringing into gaming the same lessons he’s learned from bringing his and his father’s legacy into the Web3 space. “It’s the same ideology and mindset as far as bringing in diverse creators and telling stories from different parts of the world and minority communities.” Magazine: BitCulture: Fine art on Solana, AI music, podcast + book reviews",

    "title": "Blockchain game Illuvium goes mainstream with looming Epic Games Store listing",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/illuvium-epic-games-mainstream-listing",
    "fullContent": "Blockchain games have historically battled to gain mainstream attention, but Illuvium’s listing on the Epic Games Store could change the narrative.\nBlockchain-based game Illuvium is set to tap into an audience of millions of PC and mobile gamers with its upcoming listing on the Epic Games Store, which is home to massively popular titles like Fortnite. Illuvium, an interoperable blockchain game developed by Illuvium Labs, will feature on Epic’s store from Nov. 28, following several months of background work to get the title to meet its standards. Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph ahead of the Epic launch, Illuvium co-founder Kieran Warwick outlines the evolution of the game in order to cater to a mainstream audience and comply with the platform’s legal and compatibility requirements: The game was developed using Unreal Engine 5 on the Immutable X network. Its beta launch on Epic Games will feature three different game genres set within the Illuvium universe. This includes Overworld, an open-world exploration game and “creature capturer reminiscent of beloved classics,” an auto battler strategy game called Arena and Zero, and a mobile and desktop city-builder that ties into the other titles. Warwick says its approach of building separate genres and game modes aims to attract a wider audience of gamers. “By launching three different games in three different genres, we have significantly increased our addressable market. The only issue is it has taken much longer to get to this point,” Warwick adds. Given that blockchain games featuring nonfungible token (NFT) elements have struggled to break into the mainstream, Warwick’s team has adapted its approach to onboard more users. He highlights the barrier to entry for non-Web3 native gamers as a key reason for the slow adoption of blockchain games: As Cointelegraph recently reported, Web3 venture capital firms like Animoca Brands have highlighted the hesitance of mainstream game publishers to list games that incorporate Web3 infrastructure. Animoca Brands CEO Robby Yung previously suggested that mainstream players remain uncertain about the inherent implications, fearing that Web3 integration would bypass existing business models that rely on fees for distribution. Warwick echoes these sentiments, saying that this prevailing attitude is influenced by a variety of factors. One factor is game design integrity, with some critics suggesting that including NFTs could lead to pay-to-win mechanics or negatively affect the game design by prioritizing monetization over player experience. Regulatory concerns are another consideration, with Warwick highlighting that blockchain technology and NFTs remain “in a gray area in many regions.” The volatility of cryptocurrency markets and NFTs is another hurdle that concerns mainstream publishers, as well as the perceived prevalence of fraud. Nevertheless, Illuvium’s upcoming listing bodes well for the wider blockchain gaming industry. Warwick describes it as a major milestone as their title steps onto the same platform as some of the most popular mainstream games in recent years. “This is a huge step forward. People have been saying for years that Web3 gaming is the next big thing in the crypto space,” Warwick concludes. Web3 gaming investors have adopted a more measured approach to backing early-stage studios building blockchain games over the past year. This has been necessitated by the effects of a lengthy cryptocurrency bear market, which has called for greater due diligence from industry venture capitalists.",

    "fullContent": "OpenSea’s co-lead investor, Coatue Management, marked down its investment from $120 million to $13 million.\nUnited States tech investment firm Coatue Management has marked down the value of its stake in nonfungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea by 90%. On Nov. 7, The Information reported on a document it reviewed showing that Coatue had reduced its investment from $120 million to $13 million — implying that OpenSea has fallen to an on-paper valuation of $1.4 billion. Coatue also marked down its investment in Web3 payment provider MoonPay by 90%. In January 2022, OpenSea raised $300 million in a Series C round led by crypto venture capital firm Paradigm and Coatue. The outsized investment saw the NFT platform valued at $13.3 billion. Following a stubborn bear market and a year-long slump in NFT trading activity, OpenSea announced a 50% reduction in staff on Nov. 3 as part of its plan to relaunch as OpenSea 2.0. 1/9 OpenSea is making some big changes today to focus on the next version of our product. OpenSea CEO Devin Fizner said the new version of the platform will focus on upgrading its technology and increasing its speed and quality. To Fizner, a smaller team will allow the platform to remain “nimble and attentive.” Related: Elon Musk slams NFTs but ends up arguing the case for Bitcoin Ordinals In August, OpenSea faced criticism after it announced it was retiring its operator filter, a feature that allowed creators to blacklist non-royalties enforcing marketplaces. Coatue’s markdown comes amid a slump in NFT trading volumes. The sector peaked in 2021, recording over $14 billion in sales during the year. Since then, NFT popularity has been on the decline, with overall trading volumes dropping by 80% since March 2022. A Nov. 3 report from crypto data firm DappRadar found the NFT market recorded its first month of gains in over a year, notching a $99-million increase month-over-month in October.

    "fullContent": "The Simpsons poked fun at NFTs in its annual Halloween special, but degens still managed to take advantage of the publicity to boost an NFT collection to near the top of the charts.\nThe animated television series The Simpsons spent an entire segment mocking nonfungible tokens (NFTs) during the latest 34th annual “Treehouse of Horror” Halloween special, in a segment called “Wild Barts Can’t Be Token.” In the special, Homer accidentally mints Bart on the blockchain, and in the ensuing scenes, the creators poke fun at NFTs, all while referencing collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Doodles as well as viral digital artist Beeple. Get ready for a non-fungible night in tomorrow\u0027s #TreehouseOfHorror XXXIV on @FOXTV, next day on @hulu. pic.twitter.com/Y4cSiyp4kD The special revolved around poking fun at the speculative nature of NFTs and how the market is largely fueled by the fear of missing out, FOMO. Once Marge discovers that Bart has become trapped on-chain, she too digitizes herself as an NFT. She battles her way through carriages on a virtual train — which is literally powered by FOMO — to rescue Bart, fighting NFT-themed characters all the while. The final joke lands when Homer finally gives into FOMO and mints himself as NFT. The second he does so, the train runs out of steam, and the prices of all the NFTs plunge to near-zero, ending the episode with his iconic catchphrase, “Doh!” Despite essentially being the punchline of an episode-long joke, the NFT community on Crypto Twitter reacted with delight, with Beeple saying that his work appearing on the show was a “bucket list moment” for him as an artist. Notably, The Simpsons’ creators even parodied their own NFT collection, Golden Moments, which was first offered in conjunction with Disney+ by the NFT platform VeVe in November 2021. “We saw that,” wrote the official account for Veve. We saw that @TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/nBAQEjJmyp NFT enthusiasts certainly didn’t let The Simpsons’ roast go to waste, with creators rushing to capitalize on the newfound publicity for NFTs. Just hours after the episode first aired, Italian parody artist Rino Russo launched a Simpsons-derived NFT project, which combined the likeness of Simpsons characters with CryptoPunks. The collection, dubbed Springfield Punks, was launched as a free mint and quickly sold out as NFT fans raced to jump in on the action.

Shpend Sahilu, the social lead for NFT company Yuga Labs, announced that he would be stepping down after antisemitic tweets he posted years ago resurfaced on social media. Sahilu, better known by the pseudonym NGBxShpend on X (formerly Twitter), explained that he would be leaving his role at the company due to his past antisemitic tweets becoming “a distraction” from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. “I want to apologize to anyone who I may have let down with tweets I made in poor taste,” he wrote in a Nov. 5 post on X. Hey everyone, tough day today. I am stepping down from my position at Yuga Labs. Some tweets have resurfaced from my past and it’s become a distraction from the Club and what we’re all about. These tweets do not reflect who I am or what I believe in. It has been an amazing… One user attached a screenshot of one of the offending tweets from 2016 in the comments section of the original post, showing him making a joke about Nazi leader Adolph Hitler. Yuga Labs, the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, has been accused of perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes in its artwork by controversial artists Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen. These accusations, which took the form of a knock-off NFT collection, led to a more than yearlong legal battle. However, Yuga Labs recently notched a legal victory against the provocative duo, with a court ordering Ripps and Cahen to pay $1.6 million in damages to Yuga Labs for copyright infringement. After a prolonged and continuous decline in NFT sales, the market seems to be finally showing signs of a recovery, with monthly trading volumes growing for the first time in a year, according to a report from crypto data firm DappRadar. “The year-long downward trend in NFT trading has been broken. Trading volume is up by 32% from $306 to $405 million, returning almost to levels seen in August,” the report reads. DappRadar found that NFT trading volume grew by $99 million in October compared with September, bringing overall trading activity back to levels slightly below that of August. Despite the seemingly significant increase month-over-month, it’s worth noting that October’s $340 million sum pales in comparison to the $1.98 billion in volume witnessed seven months prior in March. Regarding trading volume, Ethereum-based NFTs still dominated the market, growing more than 50% in October. Meanwhile, other networks such as Polygon, StarkWare and Flow saw their sales volume drop 48%, 42% and 32%, respectively. The report made special note of NFT activity on the Solana ecosystem, which — after being plagued by the FTX downfall — showed signs of strength, notching a 15% uptick in overall trading volume. Attendees of the Yuga Labs’ ApeFest event on Nov. 4 in Hong Kong have reported burns, damaged vision and “extreme pain” in their eyes, which they attribute to the use of improper lighting. NFT marketplace OpenSea announced on Nov. 3 that it would be laying off 50% of its total staff. Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer broke the news on X, saying the company was launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team.

The reports of vision damage in both cases line up with a condition called photokeratitis, also known as “Welder’s eye.” The condition is caused by prolonged exposure to extreme levels of UV radiation, typically from artificial sources, such as welding lamps, but can also come from natural sunlight reflecting off bright surfaces such as snow, more commonly known as snow blindness.

    "fullContent": "This is the second layoff by the pioneering NFT marketplace after the crypto winter and a stubborn bear market for collectibles.\nNonfungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea announced on Nov. 3 that it was laying off employees. Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer broke the news on X (formerly Twitter), saying the company was launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team. OpenSea launched in 2017 when NFTs were an innovation. It operates on a model comparable to eBay and Etsy and accepts payment in Ether (ETH). It laid off 20% of its employees in July 2022, citing the crypto winter, after which it had a staff of 230, according to press reports at the time. A spokesperson at the pioneering marketplace told Cointelegraph by email: The spokesperson added that around 50% of employees would be affected across all functions and particularly mentioned that the number of middle managers would be reduced. The employees would receive four-month severance packages, accelerated equity vesting and six months of continued healthcare and mental healthcare. The market for collectible NFTs peaked in 2021. Since then, use cases such as tokenizing assets, identity and legal documents have gained popularity as the value of many collectibles declined. OpenSea was in the right place at the right time with the right product. But so was Tower Records. What can OpenSea do to maintain this lead they have? The answer is simple. Become a DAO, drop a governance token to users. It will be valued in the tens of billions. Everybody wins. OpenSea faced significant community pushback in August when it announced that it was retiring its operator filter, a feature that allowed creators to blacklist marketplaces that did not enforce royalties. Yuga Labs, creator of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks NFT series, began to taper off its use of OpenSea’s Seaport marketplace smart contract in response. “As we rebuild, we’ll continue supporting our existing products, and will be iteratively testing OpenSea 2.0 in public,” Finzer said in his X post.

Borget said this will drive engagement across a range of industries: Borget said Game Maker’s tools have simplified the process for new creators to get started: Meanwhile, Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid said the firm has helped connect brands to fans of late by running contests to rebuild New York’s Times Square and architectures in The Walking Dead, among other things. The firm is working to incorporate multiplayer capabilities, which will drive this audience engagement. But Madrid acknowledged the difficulty with integrating multiplayer capabilities in metaverses at scale, particularly on blockchains. ROYAL FLUSHED Hold your breath and dive in the Sunken District.

    "fullContent": "An award-winning Web3 platform helps law firms and insurance companies enter Web3 and protect their customers by turning email communications into blockchain-verifiable NFTs.\nOn top of the fraud and scam issues related to crypto, NFTs also require intellectual property management. Web3 platform Niftyz aims to add legal clarity to the NFT market by using blockchain-verified emails to create and protect NFTs. The crypto industry is growing remarkably, even in the cornerstones of traditional finance. Take the United Kingdom, for example, where crypto asset holders jumped from 2.1 million in 2021 to almost 5 million in 2022, according to a report released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). However, it’s hard to say that the growth was all moonlight and roses. As highlighted in the same FCA report, nearly 80% of crypto asset owners do not know who to approach when they have a complaint. This is particularly concerning given the skyrocketing crypto-related fraud losses, which have increased by 41% in the U.K. in the past year, with the FTX collapse being a major contributor to this problem. The legal landscape faces increasing challenges due to the rise of tech and innovation-related fraud, as well as unmet legal needs. According to LSB research, 3.6 million people in England and Wales have unmet legal needs each year. This includes crypto and its subsectors, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The rising demand for legal services in the crypto industry is opening up a new market for lawyers. However, the legal system is struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the crypto space. Why is this? The main reason is that crypto-related innovation is, by nature, complex and constantly evolving. For example, the legal aspects of NFTs are challenging to understand. This makes it difficult to determine what the buyer is getting, what the seller can claim after the purchase, or who owns which rights. This uncertainty is a major problem for the NFT market.  NFTs come in various forms, making them complicated to manage from a legal standpoint. To top it off, the lack of regulatory supervision causes fraud and scams to run rampant in the market, causing newcomers to get even more confused about the credibility of NFTs. In such an environment, even simple tasks such as launching a new NFT collection could become an uphill battle when you factor in the legal support that would be needed in case of IP theft or trademark infringement. Niftyz, a Web3 infrastructure platform backed by Brinc and Animoca Brands, launched a new NFT minting service called Niftyz Send to address the legal concerns in the NFT creation process. Designed as a user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses, Niftyz Send also streamlines processes for law firms and insurance companies, helps them handle the growing number of crypto fraud cases, and enhances access to justice in general.  Niftyz features a user-friendly interface for email-based NFT creation. Source: Niftyz Since launching a new NFT collection can be a daunting task for Web3 newcomers, Niftyz Send takes a Web2-friendly approach instead by using the familiarity of email connection for minting. Users can transform emails into unique and traceable digital tokens, attach any type of content to them, and mint NFTs with the simplicity of sending a standard email.  Once registered with their emails, users can send and receive blockchain-certified messages as NFTs. Source: Niftyz Niftyz enables sending NFTs to either wallet or email addresses straight from the email inbox, bringing Web2 platforms into the Web3 era. By simply tokenizing creative work, intellectual property, legal proceedings, insurance policies or sensitive documents, Niftyz Send simplifies IP protection.  Each email gets a transaction ID on the blockchain, which can be publicly checked via a Block Explorer. Source: Niftyz The platform creates a transparent communication trail for legal proceedings by providing a verifiable source of evidence. Law firms can use Niftyz to send cease and desist letters to creators of unauthorized NFT campaigns, helping to fight against trademark infringement or send legal proceedings to wallets for fraud-related cases. Niftyz also offers public and private dashboards that allow users to keep the content of their NFTs hidden. Additionally, users can tokenize and record legal documents on the blockchain to create an immutable notarization record. Commenting on the state of Web3 and how it can be improved, Sara Simeone, CEO and co-founder, and Sebastiano Cataudo, chief technology officer and co-founder of Niftyz, told Cointelegraph: “We see Web3 as a powerful tool capable of reshaping how users and businesses engage, discreetly enhancing communication for increased seamlessness, accountability and transparency. We are committed to making Web3 a seamless technology embedded in our day-to-day life.” Serving as a user-friendly entry point to Web3 and legal technology, Niftyz Send enables hassle-free interaction with blockchain technology for individuals and law firms, mitigating complexities and making NFT adoption accessible to all. By addressing the limitations and challenges posed by the legal landscape, Niftyz Send paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and accountable legal processes, ultimately enhancing access to justice and reducing unmet legal needs.

    "fullContent": "Sanjay Raghavan believes that the tokenization of real estate could bring Web3 adoption and provide a diversification alternative for crypto natives.\nThe tokenization of real-world assets has been tipped as a major use case of blockchain technology that could drive Web3 adoption. In episode 35 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw interviews Sanjay Raghavan, vice president of Web3 Initiatives at Roofstock onChain, about tokenized real estate on the blockchain and how digital real estate investing interacts with the nonfungible tokens market and the decentralized finance landscape. Raghavan also talks about fractional nonfungible tokens (NFTs), regulations and the risks related to Web3 real estate platforms. Raghavan explains how real estate is sold on the blockchain using NFTs. Companies that sell real estate on-chain must first purchase the property and create a limited liability company (LLC). An NFT is then created, which is associated with the ownership of the LLC. When users buy the NFT, they buy the LLC, which means they have purchased the property. Raghavan tells Hashing It Out that regulations for tokenizing real-world assets can be complex. In the United States, for instance, various states have rules on the sale of assets, meaning that com navigate separate compliance requirements across 50 jurisdictions. Beyond bringing people from the traditional real estate market to Web3, Raghavan believes that crypto natives may see real estate tokenization as a diversification tool. He explains that most investment alternatives in the industry may be highly correlated to the Bitcoin (BTC) price, and having another stable and less correlated asset could be a reason for exposure to real estate NFTs. Raghavan also talks about the fractionalization of assets, including NFTs, which may require running a securities program that makes it unattractive for companies working in the United States. On the other hand, non-U.S. citizens may be able to access fractional NFTs in the future if firms outside the jurisdiction buy properties and sell the NFTs in other markets.

    "fullContent": "Elon Musk argued that NFT projects “should at least encode the JPEG in the blockchain,” to the delight of many Bitcoiners.\nWhile publicly mocking nonfungible tokens (NFTs) during a podcast, Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk appears to have inadvertently highlighted the case for Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs. “The funny thing is the NFT is not even on the blockchain — it’s just a URL to the JPEG,” said Musk in an Oct. 31 released interview on The Joe Rogan Experience. Musk said NFT projects should at least encode the JPEG on-chain: On social media, Bitcoiners argued Musk’s comments actually summed up the use case for Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin’s version of NFTs was launched in January by developer Casey Rodarmor, which was made possible by the Taproot soft fork in November 2021. Cryptocurrency analyst Will Clemente was among those who praised Musk’s comments, noting there are 38 million and counting Ordinals inscriptions that will forever exist on Bitcoin’s blockchain. .@elonmusk you just laid out the case for Bitcoin ordinals - image/text inscriptions directly on the most secure open source monetary network on the planet. There are currently 38 million of these inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain. pic.twitter.com/WASj1qpkz8 “This is why Ordinals will continue to grow,” said Rohun “Frank” Vora, the creator of NFT projects DeGods and y00ts. “It’s the most elegant solution to one of the most universal criticisms of NFTs.” Ordinals developer known as “Leonidas” liked Musk’s comments so much that they inscribed the 19-second video into Bitcoin’s blockchain at block 814,773: The criticisms from Musk toward NFTs aren’t new. In December 2021, he mocked NFTs as a sign of mental illness in a meme showing a patient lying on a therapist’s couch. pic.twitter.com/Wv6iJDuTge Musk’s comments, however, don’t stand true for all NFT projects on Ethereum. For example, Larva Labs moved its CryptoPunks NFTs on-chain in August 2021 after they lived off-chain for the first four years. “Storing them on-chain in this way would further cement the long-term survival of the Cryptopunks images and attributes, and ensure that they can be fully accessed by anyone with only an Ethereum client,” Larva Labs said in the statement. .@elonmusk is correct that having NFT merely provide an http link to someone\u0027s domain is silly. However, with rare exceptions, it\u0027s also silly to insist NFT content be on chain, IPFS links, with the content backed by whoever owns the NFT is the natural solution. Related: Are NFT markets in a death spiral or ready for a resurgence? Metagood, the team behind the Ethereum-native OnChainMonkeys, announced in September that it would migrate its NFTs to Bitcoin. While the firm’s CEO, Danny Yang, didn’t directly address the JPEG dilemma, he explained that NFTs “will win on Bitcoin” because it is a securer network to work from: However, Ethereum still remains home to 84% of all NFT trading volumes, according to CoinGecko, sourcing data from June. Bitcoin and ImmutableX came in second and third with market shares of 11% and 2.5%, respectively.

    "fullContent": "“It’s not just a piece of artwork”: Mintable CEO Zach Burks argues that the United Kingdom government still hasn’t caught up on what NFTs are becoming.\nThe United Kingdom’s government is in danger of regulating nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in a way that doesn’t suit the true nature of the nascent technology, says Mintable CEO and founder Zach Burks. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Burks said he believes a recent report from a U.K. parliamentary committee significantly exaggerates the role NFTs play in copyright infringement and fails to recognize that they are more than just volatile digital pictures. “NFTs are in a transition phase where they’re moving away from the speculative boom of PFPs, and now it’s going into utilities of brands implementing NFTs across a whole range of different things,” Burks explained. In the Oct. 11 report, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee urged the government to take action to protect artists and content creators from copyright infringement associated with NFTs. NFT marketplaces need to do more to address the scale of copyright infringement on their platforms. We\u0027ve published our report on \"NFTs and the Blockchain: risks to sport and culture\". Find out more: https://t.co/4pYE6gAngw Read our report: https://t.co/XIj0LYlcrX@cj_dinenage pic.twitter.com/GTbtOJCM8m Burks acknowledged that copyright protections and intellectual property rights for artists are of paramount importance, pointing to Mintable’s own IP protection algorithm it uses to prevent plagiarism on its platform. However, he explained that while these issues should be a top priority for all NFT platforms, they’re not exactly NFT-specific concerns. “Regulators say, ‘Well now, NFTs are being used for copyright infringement.’ Well yeah, so is WordPress. So is YouTube. So is Spotify,” he said. “And how do you combat that? Well, you have some of the largest, most advanced companies in the world, like Google, working on this.” Burks, who personally corresponds with U.K. government officials on NFTs on a weekly basis, said that while NFT platforms should be doing their utmost to protect artists, it falls on regulators to embrace a more nuanced view of NFTs as a whole. Was such a great time speaking at the 40th International Symposium on Economic Crimes at Cambridge University in the UK! Learned so much, met some amazing people, and hopefully educated the people who listened to my many panels about NFTs and the blockchain space! pic.twitter.com/txExSVqTIb “There are so many ways that you can utilize NFTs, whether it’s for your car records, for your property records, whether it’s a bank settlement document, whether it’s a backup layer, whether it’s a full supply chain system or a biofuels company,” he said. “If my website is used to sell books, I’m governed by the laws that are used to sell books. If I sell drugs on my website, then you don’t need new laws. I’m still just selling drugs, right?” he said. In Burks’ view, NFTs are an extremely broad technology capable of a vast array of different functions, and having a committee declare that they be regulated as pieces of digital art could be a significant setback to unveiling the true utility of the technology. “The [committee] said the government should implement the EU 17 copyright directive on NFTs, which is bad in the sense that it’s a really broad umbrella,” he said. Related: NFTs aren’t dead — they’re just resting In the report, the committee said the “most pressing issue” raised by NFTs was the risk to artists’ intellectual property rights arising from the ease and speed at which tokens can be minted. It suggested they be regulated under a relatively narrow copyright directive: Article 17 of the European Union Directive on Copyright. “When you say all NFTs need to have this one element of regulatory coverage, this is the equivalent of saying, ‘We need this one piece of legislation that covers this piece of technology,’ which might’ve started at the Edison light bulb but now we’re dealing with Teslas,” Burks said. Ultimately, Burks believes the U.K. government could take some notes from regulators in Singapore, where the government judges NFTs by their specific use cases. “Regulators in Singapore look at what an NFT actually is, and then they go from there,” he explained. “Say you’ve got an NFT of a Tesla stock. Well then, that’s a security. Oh, this is an NFT of a bag of cocaine that’s facilitating the sale of drugs? Then they regulate the same way they would illicit drugs.” Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 \u0026 crypto gaming, Formula E",

    "fullContent": "German brands embrace NFTs, exploring new ways to engage with customers and build brand loyalty.\nFor the most part, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have two primary use cases: Buying and selling digital products (digital art, virtual fashion items) and building digital communities (exclusive memberships, access to events). These use cases can be easily adopted by brands and companies, such as fashion brands selling digital clothes, various companies offering NFT-based club memberships and musicians holding exclusive concerts for their fans. Traditional German companies are also jumping on the bandwagon, recognizing the potential of NFT technology to innovate and market their products and services. Deutsche Post, the German postal service, will release its first limited-edition collectible stamp on Nov. 2, 2023. A classic self-adhesive stamp will come with a digital image — an NFT representing ownership of the stamp. The first stamp features a pixellated image of the Brandenburg Gate generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Upcoming stamps in the collection will feature other iconic German landmarks. It remains to be seen whether the NFT stamp collection will be a commercial success. However, it is a significant step for Deutsche Post, which is looking to expand its reach into the digital world.

Mehr: https://t.co/IqcouOeygG pic.twitter.com/XS4y5nkFCo NFTs can also be used for various loyalty programs, offering customers a more rewarding and engaging experience while providing businesses with a new way to connect with their customers and build brand loyalty. An example of such a program is Lufthansa’s NFT loyalty program on the Polygon network. In collaboration with Lufthansa Innovation Hub and Miles \u0026 More, its frequent flyer program, Lufthansa has developed the Uptrip mobile application that allows passengers to turn their travel experiences into NFTs. These NFTs can then be redeemed for rewards such as mileage bonuses and business lounge vouchers. Lufthansa\u0027s @Uptrip_app loyalty program is building #onPolygon to turn flights into rewards Collect NFT trading cards for every flight and claim rewards Learn more about the new Miles \u0026 More and @LHInnovationHub experience: https://t.co/MjQihK8xUx pic.twitter.com/JfUEoUJxNR According to Christopher Siegloch, head of program development and services at Miles \u0026 More, the app has already generated significant interest among Lufthansa customers. Since its launch, over 20,000 users have registered, and more than 200,000 collectible cards have been issued. Siegloch highlights that gamification elements play a crucial role in introducing participants to Web3 technologies like NFTs, and the app successfully translates the enthusiasm for collecting into the digital realm. Furthermore, in the second half of 2023, the app will introduce a digital marketplace where users can trade and sell their NFTs, with special NFT reward offers planned for the future. NFTs are also reaching out to fashion brands. For example, German apparel company Adidas continues to refine its Web3 strategy by actively using NFTs to find new ways to engage with its community of athletes, sneakerheads and sports enthusiasts. Recently, Adidas introduced a series of limited-edition NFT sneakers inspired by their iconic footwear designs. These digital sneakers can be showcased in virtual environments, allowing users to express their love for the brand in the metaverse. Adidas is also discovering new ways to use the full potential of NFT to encourage its community. The last example is The Adidas /// Studio, or Triple Stripes Studio, which launched a Web3-based digital artist-in-residency program to showcase and support budding creators in the NFT space. According to Adidas, the goal is to support and nurture creative talents in the digital realm, providing artists with an opportunity to showcase their work and collaborate with the sportswear giant. This collaboration extends beyond digital projects and may include physical products in the future. Another German fashion brand, Hugo Boss, has also entered the NFT arena with a focus on fashion in the metaverse. The company collaborated with renowned digital fashion designers to create a series of exclusive NFT clothing items. These digital fashion pieces can be worn by avatars in virtual worlds, allowing users to dress in style even in the digital realm. Mercedes-Benz boasts a rich history spanning more than 130 years, attracting a dedicated following of nostalgia enthusiasts and collectors. The brand’s iconic models, vintage cars and related artifacts, whether in their original form or as miniature models and toys, continue to hold appeal. In line with its strategic direction, the German automaker is venturing into the Web3 space through the launch of Mercedes-Benz NXT to enhance its engagement with the community. In September, Mercedes-Benz launched its third NFT collection: The Era of Luxury. These collectibles created by Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons are digital reinterpretations of the most remarkable designs from seven design eras. The collection spans from the present day to the early history of automobiles. 1/ What a fantastic reveal on Wednesday! In this thread, we would like to show you a selection of combinations of the Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons from “The Era of Luxury”. Let us start with Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons #41 collected by Pakwalker. ↓ pic.twitter.com/ogyubfA9M8 All three NFT collections show how Mercedes-Benz actively explores opportunities to blend the digital realm with automotive design. This endeavor is spearheaded by the brand’s chief design officer, Gorden Wagener, who guides the Mercedes-Benz design team in creating digital collectibles. The primary objective is to reinterpret the brand’s most iconic designs, presenting them in the digital format of NFT cards. Ritter Sport, a German chocolate brand, also ventured into the NFT world by launching a limited series of digital chocolate bars as NFTs in August 2023. The NFT collection is called Art of the Square and consists of 256 digital pixel art pieces, each depicting a square Ritter Sport bar. gm! Ganz im Sinne von Clara Ritter haben wir eine Kollektion an Digital Collectibles entworfen: „Art of the square“ geht am 23.08. um 16 Uhr in den Verkauf, die Allowlist ist schon online! Hier entlang: https://t.co/oSYzlJqKb8 \u0026 https://t.co/WnzbYI3c71#web3 #digitalart #hodl pic.twitter.com/9gIEcKpkNe Not only Ritter Sport uses such creative marketing strategies to engage with a tech-savvy audience. Other German food brands have also released their NFT collections. For example, confectioner Katjes released its NFT collection of three unicorn babies named Dash, Willow and Sparkles in April 2023. This was Katjes’ second NFT campaign after releasing a limited-edition collection of 777 unicorn NFTs in May 2022. Both campaigns were a way for Katjes to reach a younger audience, as unicorn babies are a popular character among children and teenagers. Haribo, a German confectionery company famous for its gummy bears, has also entered the NFT world. In April 2023, the company filed for NFT trademarks in the United States, indicating its plans to expand its brand into the digital world. The trademarks cover a wide range of digital assets, including digital avatars, multimedia files with confectionery-related artwork, cartoons and other items authenticated by NFTs. German confectionery company #HARIBO has registered its name as a trademark for: ✅ Smartwatches ✅ VR Glasses ✅ Media verified by NFTs ✅ Jewelry and Toys ... and much more!#NFT #MetaverseNFT #GoldBears #Trademark #Candy #NFTs #VR pic.twitter.com/y7WqNVJC7c Adidas, Haribo, Lufthansa, Deutsche Post and other traditional German brands have joined the growing list of businesses venturing into the NFT space. This expansion marks a significant shift in the perception of NFTs, as they are no longer viewed solely as a niche investment opportunity. Instead, NFTs are increasingly being seen as a mainstream marketing tool and a way to experiment with new concepts that bridge the virtual and physical worlds and build new communities.",

    "fullContent": "Fanton brings blockchain-based fantasy football to Telegram thanks to the IM service’s recent integration with the TON blockchain.\nWhat’s a better way than combining the world’s most popular sports with Web2’s most socialized aspects to introduce new users to Web3 through gaming? Association football, or soccer, boasts the largest fan base among sports enthusiasts, with over 3.5 billion estimated people rooting for their favorite teams. Built mainly for football fans, the fantasy sports industry, a vast network of virtual sports leagues where users can create their own teams, has also grown to become a $25 billion global market. Mixing fantasy football with blockchain features like nonfungible token (NFT) cards could create an ideal entry point to Web3 for the masses. However, current platforms present complex mechanics for newcomers, and most of them lack in-platform user interaction —a big loss considering the social aspect of fantasy football. Fanton has built a fantasy football game that is integrated into Telegram to benefit from the instant messenger service’s 800 million-strong user base. It features collectible cards of top football players that earn points according to their real-life performances. These cards are issued on the blockchain as NFTs and can be easily traded among players. The game benefits from Telegram’s recent integration with The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which enables the use of a noncustodial wallet directly from the Telegram app. Users can create a virtual football team with their cards of players, and earn points for their players’ actions in the real world. The teams are made of five players: a goalkeeper, a defender, a midfielder, a forward and a substitute player. These players earn points based on their performances in their real-life football matches. Points are awarded for various actions, such as goals, assists and saves of goal chances by the goalkeeper. The combined score of the points equals the team score. Tournaments are organized based on match days of real football leagues, including the English Premier League, Spanish LaLiga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A and the French Ligue 1. Players can partake in a special championship consisting of the most important matches from the five European leagues, the Brazilian Championship and the UEFA Champions League, the world\u0027s most prestigious championship. Users can join these tournaments by paying a participation fee, of which 85% is added to the prize pool while 15% goes to Fanton. Teams that score more points than others are rewarded with TON coins and collectible cards.  Fanton features soccer superstars as NFT cards. Source: Fanton Cards are divided into rarity classes based on their scarcity, giving them value and uniqueness. Non-NFT cards are classified as common, while NFT cards can have rare, epic and legendary rarities. The game is free to play and provides common cards without charge for everyone who wants to participate. The rarer NFT cards should be purchased to take part in special NFT tournaments with higher prizes. Fanton became a part of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program with its straightforward product that is already showing good traction in user onboarding and revenue. The Cointelegraph Accelerator team was inspired by the innovative game-in-a-messenger format, easy user onboarding and the perspective of crypto adoption via messengers. The platform has over 350,000 users and surpassed $40,000 in monthly revenue. With a seasoned team of 15 based in Spain and Indonesia, the game managed to raise $300,000 in a pre-seed round in February. Today, October 27, 2023, Fanton launched its product on Product Hunt, a platform where users can discover and upvote new products. Fanton encourages its supporters to visit Product Hunt on Friday and upvote the product.",

    "fullContent": "The NFT artists were also ordered to cover Yuga Labs’ legal fees after determining the trademark infringement constituted an “exceptional case.”\nA United States district court judge has ordered nonfungible token (NFT) artists Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen to pay Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs a total of $1.57 million in disgorgement and damages, along with legal fees, bringing an end to the long-running “copycat” NFT lawsuit. The Oct. 25 order follows an April 21 partial summary judgment granted in favor of Yuga Labs after the firm claimed that Ripps and Cahen, the defendants, violated copyright laws by making copycat versions of its Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collectibles. District Court Judge John Walter awarded Yuga Labs $1.37 million after concluding the NFT firm was entitled to a disgorgement of the defendants’ profits. An additional $200,000 was awarded in statutory damages relating to cybersquatting violations. Yuga Labs v. Ryder Ripps et al - Notes from the Court\u0027s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Yuga is awarded $1,375,362.92 in Ds profits, $200,000 in statutory damages, and attorneys\u0027 fees and costs (amount TBD). A permanent injunction is also issued against Ds. 1/ pic.twitter.com/2dTiuWpZSA Yuga Labs has also been entitled to recover attorney fees and costs from the NFT artists after the judge determined the trademark infringement constituted an “exceptional case.” “A trademark case is generally considered exceptional for purposes of awarding of attorneys’ fees when a party has taken positions that can be characterized as ‘malicious, fraudulent, deliberate or willful,’” the judge noted. Judge Walter also knocked back the defendants’ argument that the copycat BAYC versions were “satire” and “parody,” ruling that the defendants intentionally infringed Yuga’s BAYC trademarks with a bad faith intent to profit from them. He also noted the defendants continued to market and promote their copycat BAYC versions after the partial summary judgment was delivered against them in April. Yuga Labs filed the lawsuit against the two artists in June 2022. In an Oct. 16 hearing in a United States appeals court, Ripps and Cahen’s lawyers tried to argue the lawsuit should be thrown out on the grounds of free speech under California’s anti-SLAPP statute. However, the three-judge panel didn’t appear persuaded by the lawyer’s arguments. Related: NFTs aren’t dead — They’re just resting BAYC is one of the most valuable NFT collectibles on NFT marketplace OpenSea.

    "fullContent": "Online art store Avant Arte is offering print copies of CryptoPunks for the next 48 hours through a partnership with CryptoPunks brand owner Yuga Labs.\nHolders of CryptoPunk nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are being offered the chance to obtain physical prints of their digital art items, according to an Oct. 26 announcement. The items are being offered as part of a partnership between online art store Avant Arte and CryptoPunks brand owner Yuga Labs. The sale will last for only 48 hours. It began on Oct. 26 at 3:00 pm UTC and will end on Oct. 28 at 3:00 pm UTC. Our print collaboration with @avant_arte is officially live – for 48 hours only. Punk On-Chain is available exclusively to CryptoPunk holders at https://t.co/skT1FKTJgB pic.twitter.com/X657IqdgUT Two different versions of the physical CryptoPunks collection are being offered on Avant Arte. The first is called “Punk-On-Chain.” Each punk owner can commission a Punk-on-Chain print copy for each digital CryptoPunk they own. However, users will need to prove ownership to commission a print copy. This means that individuals who do not own the on-chain version cannot buy its print version. The second collection is called “10,000 On-Chain,” which is a print collection of all 10,000 CryptoPunks that’s open to anyone. Collectors can buy the print version of a 10,000 On-Chain Punk even if they don’t own the original on-chain version. The two different versions of each printed punk are distinguishable from each other by a variety of characteristics. For example, the 10,000 On-Chain pieces are archival pigment prints with a silkscreen varnish seal, whereas the Punks-On-Chain pieces are UV pigment prints with white underpins. Both versions of each punk contain a Yuga Labs holographic sticker to prove their authenticity. The Punks-On-Chain items also feature a QR code on the back of the print, leading to a blockchain-based digital Certificate of Authenticity (CoA). As for the 10,000 On-Chain pieces, they ship with a physical CoA that contains a QR code leading to the digital CoA, but this QR code is not on the print itself. Related: BAYC creator Yuga Labs completes restructuring to focus on metaverse CryptoPunks was one of the first algorithmically generated art collections to be distributed through blockchain technology. It was developed by Larva Labs and released in June 2017. The pieces were originally free to any Ethereum network user who wanted to mint them. At the time of publication, the lowest-priced CryptoPunks sell for approximately $78,000, and the entire collection has a market capitalization of over $782 million, according to data from CoinGecko. Larva Labs sold the copyrights for CryptoPunks to fellow NFT development team Yuga Labs in March 2022.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-based-virtual-nations-a-new-era-of-governance-and-inclusivity-qa-with-jur-network-and-draper-startup-house",
    "fullContent": "Blockchain-based communities aim to address societal and governance needs, providing better and cheaper services and improving the decision-making process.\nBlockchain-based virtual nations are an emerging concept in the digital realm that seeks to address various societal and governance needs like reduced bureaucracy, better legal systems, cheaper services, democratic decision-making and inclusivity. These virtual nations are decentralized, blockchain-based communities that offer several potential benefits, such as digital sovereignty, transparency, and community-driven governing. In this world increasingly shaped by digital technologies, a Bitcoin-native society Draper Nation, is a new concept poised to redefine traditional notions of governance and societal structures. Underpinned by the Jur Network, a decentralized technical infrastructure, Draper Nation offers a unique model for governance and service delivery. Citizens of Draper Nation have direct ownership and influence over the network and will be able to participate in decision-making processes and activities that actively involve the general public. Vikram Bharati, founder of Draper Startup House, and Alessio Treglia, chief technology officer of the Jur Network, explain in this interview what opportunities Draper Nation offers its citizens and whether such projects can make us a stronger and more engaged citizenry. CT: Vikram, Draper Nation is a revolutionary concept in the crypto space. Could you share the origin story of this Bitcoin-native society and what inspired its creation? Vikram Bharati: Since 2018, we’ve been building physical startup societies around the world through Draper Startup Houses. It dawned on us that by connecting individuals with shared values from different parts of the world, we were creating comprehensive global ecosystems and economies. This realization led us to understand that, in a sense, we were building micronations within other nations. We then realized that there was no reason why we couldn’t create our own virtual nation. All the necessary ingredients were already in place — we just needed to bring them together. 🚀 Introducing Draper Nation: A New Digital Horizon 🌐#DraperNation as envisioned by legendary Silicon Valley investor @TimDraper \u0026 powered by @JurProject, is a borderless, community-driven, and Bitcoin-native #StartupSociety. Let\u0027s dive in to discover more 🧵 pic.twitter.com/xzjTo1L6aI CT: Alessio, for our readers new to the term, could you explain what “Network States” are and how they’re poised to redefine traditional notions of governance and societal structures? Alessio Treglia: Network states are online, decentralized entities that operate very much like states, but they lack control over physical land. They are the successors of the traditional sovereign states. By leveraging Web3 trustless technical tools, network states would allow citizens to interact and trade seamlessly and frictionlessly, causing efficiency to skyrocket and cost to become neglectable. CT: The Jur Network is integral to Draper Nation’s functionality. Could you delve into how it underpins the operations and governance of these emerging Network States? Alessio Treglia: The Jur Network is a decentralized technical infrastructure designed to facilitate on-chain decision-making processes and activities involving the general public in the day-to-day operations of digital communities. Our primary goal is to encourage more people to join these communities and engage directly in public discourse and action. In perspective, while a Facebook user interacts primarily as a consumer within the Facebook network, a Jur Network user has direct ownership and influence over the network. Draper Nation serves as our first real-world, large-scale user community — a critical proving ground where Jur Engineering turns abstract network concepts into practical, real-world applications. CT: Given your extensive experience in blockchain, Alessio, how do you see global trends around decentralization influencing the future of national governance and economies? Alessio Treglia: Global decentralization trends are fundamentally reshaping national governance and economies. In a completely borderless world, centralized control drops its mask and finally appears for what it is — the number one enemy of democracies based on active participation and equality. Peer-to-peer banking and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have given us a glimpse of the future. Now, we can empower individuals by ensuring financial inclusion and democratizing access to resources and opportunities. Governance models will gradually shift to decentralized models that allow citizens to participate in decision-making and policy formulation in a transparent and equitable manner. CT: Vikram, Draper Nation emphasizes community, especially through its NFT passport initiative. How do you envision this fostering a stronger, more engaged citizenry? Vikram Bharati: Draper Nation will eventually offer numerous services typically provided by governments. Since everything will be virtual and without intermediaries, we will be able to deliver these services at a fraction of the cost. The NFT passport will serve as the citizen-owned digital ID, granting the citizens access to all products and services.  CT: Startup cities are a fascinating aspect of Draper Nation. Could you explain how these special economic zones (SEZs) operate and the benefits they offer to residents, both virtual and physical? Vikram Bharati: We are passionate about a new concept of Startup Cities. Think of them as neighborhoods tailored to the needs and dreams of everyone who lives there. They’re not just places to live, they’re hubs filled with exciting perks and services. What excites me is our effort to seamlessly weave in Web3 capabilities. So imagine handling things like Visa applications, setting up your business, managing insurance, and even paying taxes, all integrated and simplified. We’re trying to eliminate unnecessary middlemen and make everything more direct and efficient. But what will set our cities apart? It’s the spirit of innovation and collaboration. Living there means you’re not just a neighbor: you’re an integral part of its history, its growth. So imagine living in a place where you’re not just a resident but an invested stakeholder, celebrating every milestone of your own Startup City. CT: Looking ahead, what major milestones can we expect from Draper Nation and the Jur Network in the upcoming year? Vikram Bharati: The first year of Draper Nation will be experimental as we seek to understand who truly wants to be a part of this new nation and what the citizens’ aspirations are for its future. In essence, we want to co-create this nation with the help of its citizens. We will co-write the Manifesto and then the Constitution of Draper Nation through community-driven activities. We have already held two inaugural events and have more to come with the opening of a new embassy in Hyderabad. Netizens will have access to benefits of various kinds: free accommodations for events, scholarships, and more. CT: How do you both see the evolution of crypto and blockchain technologies impacting global governance models in the long term? Is there potential for a “Democracy 2.0”? Alessio Treglia: We’re on the cusp of what some call “Democracy 2.0”, and it’s not just a technological shift. It’s an exciting socio-political evolution. Imagine a world where bureaucratic hurdles are a thing of the past, where citizens can participate directly, and where every voice truly matters in shaping governance. This transformation promises to unleash an unprecedented wave of democratic energy and inclusiveness. CT: Are there any upcoming yet-to-be-announced developments that you’d like to share exclusively with our readers today? Alessio Treglia: The Jur Network is in the process of transitioning to proof-of-stake (PoS) and will soon enable JUR staking. We will soon enable the creation of new tokens and economies for Jur-based societies. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/neon-machine-raises-20-m-series-a-web-3-blockchain-based-call-of-duty-competitor-shrapnel",
    "fullContent": "The company claims a cast of employees whose collective entertainment industry resume contains titles such as Halo, Call of Duty and Westworld.\nWeb3 gaming developer Neon Machine raised $20 million in Series A funding toward the development of its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Shrapnel. This round follows a $10.5 million seed round completed in June of 2021. It was led by Polychain Capital and included funding from Griffin Gaming Partners, Brevan Howard Digital, Franklin Templeton, IOSG Ventures and Tess Ventures. Shrapnel is an ambitious gaming project touted by Neon Machine as a AAA game — an expression for video games with top-tier production value, budgeting and marketing. According to gameplay footage shown on Neon Machine’s YouTube page and documentation on the game’s website, Shrapnel is a first-person shooter featuring multiplayer components. Competition in the game — which currently has yet to enter pre-alpha testing — will purportedly come in the form of “extraction” mechanics requiring the player to escape with any loot they find in-game in order to retain those items. Early gameplay videos show what appears to be a gameplay loop consistent with Call of Duty: Warzone, a popular free-to-play extraction shooter developed by Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard studio. What separates Shrapnel from similar AAA competition is its reliance on Web3 and blockchain. While other games, such as The Division 2, have mechanics in place where players can “extract” valuable items in order to apply them to their character and profiles, the assets in Shrapnel are connected to the blockchain. According to the studio, this allows the players full ownership over the assets. Related: Shrapnel Web3 shooter won’t let US users cash out, thanks to Gensler Shrapnel will also feature a modding toolset that, theoretically, could allow players or developers to insert other blockchain assets into the game world for players to interact with. This could, hypothetically, create an intriguing scenario for both seasonal competition and tournament play. The game is slated for early-access testing for paid subscribers in December, according to a press release from Neon Machine. Once the initial evaluation period ends, the company intends to launch the game as a free-to-play title “sometime” in 2024. Beyond the development and launch of Shrapnel, Neon Machine has also said that it intends to eventually license its Web3 developer’s API platform, GameBridge, after the launch.",

    "fullContent": "A Singapore court permitted the use of NFTs to attach legal court orders tokenized as an NFT to issue a freeze order.\nWelcome to the latest edition of Cointelegraph’s Nifty Newsletter. Keep reading to stay up-to-date with the latest stories on nonfungible tokens. Every Wednesday, the Nifty Newsletter informs and inspires you to dig deeper into the latest NFT trends and insights. In this week’s newsletter, read about how a nonfungible token (NFT) became a focus point in a Singapore court battle, learn about the importance of decentralized randomness in the Web3 gaming sector and find out why Universal Music Group is suing Anthropic over copyright infringement. The Singapore High Court has allowed financial investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary to attach NFTs containing a legal document to cold wallets associated with a hack, according to United Kingdom-based iSanctuary and local press accounts. A court-issued worldwide freeze order was tokenized as soulbound NFTs and attached to the wallets in question. The NFTs will not prevent transactions with the wallets but will serve as a warning to counterparties and exchanges that the wallets were involved in a hack. In addition, iSanctuary claimed it had devised a means of tracking funds leaving the wallets, thanks to the NFTs. The NFTs will be permanently attached to the wallets. Continue reading Random numbers are of great importance in a number of applications, including games, security systems, decentralized autonomous organization governance and NFT generation. If your game cannot access randomly generated numbers, your starts will become repetitive and stale. If your security system relies on easily guessed authentication codes, it isn’t providing much security. If any system that needs variety isn’t getting it, it won’t be very effective. For many applications, this is effective. True randomness is not required in every application. In a video game with random encounters, for example, there may only be a limited number of actions the game can take at any given time. A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that provides values outside a given scope isn’t going to be of much use. When the stakes are low, technical requirements often match. However, the quality of a PRNG can vary dramatically. This can be an issue for applications with higher stakes, with many people depending on them or in various use cases. Continue reading Universal Music Group, Concord Publishing and ABKCO Music \u0026 Records have filed a lawsuit against the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, accusing the latter of committing copyright infringement when training its artificial intelligence chatbot, Claude. The lawsuit was filed on Oct. 18 and claims that Anthropic “unlawfully” copied and disseminated “vast amounts of copyrighted works - including the lyrics to myriad musical compositions” that are under the ownership or control of the publishers.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/revolutionizing-whitelist-marketplace-for-web3-whitelist-zone-partners-with-cointelegraph-accelerator",
    "fullContent": "The whitelist marketplace WhiteList Zone onboarded over 50 projects that collectively submitted more than 8,000 whitelists.\nIn the Web3 space, one of the key challenges for new projects and products is to get a motivated audience and for crypto-enthusiasts and investors — to find the most promising projects and get in earlier than others. This is where whitelists step in, addressing several critical aspects. A whitelist is a curated list of addresses or users with authorized access to specific privileges. It grants entry to activities like presales, token sales, initial coin offerings (ICOs), nonfungible token (NFT) minting, or access to various events. It works as an exclusive guest list, allowing only approved participants to join the party while keeping others out. For crypto-enthusiasts and investors, whitelists represent an early-access opportunity to secure a position ahead of the crowd, enabling them to purchase assets or participate in events before the general public. Being on a whitelist often grants lower entry prices, additional token allocations or lower gas fees, enhancing the investment potential. A prominent example is the Bored Ape Yacht Club participants who received free NFTs that later had a market value significantly higher than their original price. For projects, whitelists serve as a strategic tool to onboard the most motivated users, encouraging them to engage in activities like social media promotion and friend referrals to earn a coveted spot on the whitelist. Moreover, whitelists ensure a fair and equitable distribution of tokens or resources, reducing the risk of concentrated ownership. They also serve as a regulatory safeguard by implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which verify participants\u0027 identities. In essence, whitelists act as a robust security measure, shielding projects from potential scams or malicious actors by thoroughly vetting participants in advance, ensuring that only legitimate individuals or entities can participate in their events or projects. However, getting on the whitelist is a complex and risky endeavor. Users often need to register their wallets on the project\u0027s website as part of the onboarding process and compete with thousands of other crypto-enthusiasts for a small amount of available spots. Additionally, they must demonstrate their eligibility by completing various laborious tasks, including generating user-generated content, social media support (likes, shares, subscriptions), securing referrals, and undertaking actions that enhance the project\u0027s brand awareness. For those unable to secure a whitelist spot legitimately, a black and gray market offers an alternative, but it’s often fraught with risks. Transactions in this realm take place in less regulated and secure environments, such as over-the-counter (OTC) groups on Telegram or Discord, leaving participants vulnerable to fraudulent schemes and malicious actors who can take advantage of their trust and desire for whitelist access. In response to these challenges, a groundbreaking solution has emerged — WhiteList Zone. Launched in alpha in June 2023, WhiteList Zone has quickly established itself as a marketplace where crypto enthusiasts can directly purchase whitelists from launchpads, project owners and whitelist winners. These whitelists serve as golden tickets, granting investors the right to participate in initial decentralized offerings (IDOs), NFT mintings and other events hosted by crypto projects. Investors can say goodbye to the gray markets and uncertain terrain of Telegram and Discord channels, as WhiteList Zone now provides safe and easy access to whitelists. To buy whitelist spots, investors simply need to visit the marketplace, browse the list of available projects, select their preferred one and complete the transaction in less than a minute.  Users can discover new projects based on category, network, or sale type. Source: WhiteList Zone WhiteList Zone believes in direct collaboration with launchpads and projects to ensure that scams and fraud are a thing of the past. By establishing these partnerships, the platform creates a reliable ecosystem right from the start. This means that when users access whitelist opportunities on WhiteList Zone, they can trust that they are engaging in legitimate transactions. What’s more, WhiteList Zone offers an easy-to-use interface and a simple onboarding experience and continues to expand its support, currently accommodating over 140 cryptocurrencies, with plans to introduce convenient credit card payment options soon. When it comes to projects looking to issue whitelists, WhiteList Zone also emerges as the top choice, as the marketplace boosts engagement among whitelist winners. This proactive and engaged community is a valuable asset for projects seeking active participation and support. Moreover, the platform generates valuable data that empowers projects to make informed decisions. This data-driven approach aids in strategizing and optimizing whitelist distribution, resulting in more effective outcomes. WhiteList Zone recently became the latest participant of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program. The Accelerator has picked WhiteList Zone due to the latter’s potential to disrupt the whitelist market. With a team of 15 people, the Ukraine-based project has shown good traction since launching the alpha version in June 2023. The marketplace has successfully attracted users from 71 countries and onboarded over 50 projects that have collectively contributed more than 8,000 whitelists. Furthermore, WhiteList Zone has plans to launch its token generation event in the second quarter of 2024.",

    "title": "Game review: Immutable’s Guild of Guardians offers mobile dungeon adventures",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/gaming-immutable-guild-of-guardians-blockchain",
    "fullContent": "Guild of Guardians is a dungeon-crawling mobile adventure game with a play-to-earn twist.\nFrom Oct. 9–20, Immutable invited playtesters to try out an early demo of its upcoming mobile game, Guild of Guardians. Guild of Guardians was first announced in 2021. Its utility token, Guild of Guardians Gems (GOG), went up for sale in December 2021, raising over $5.3 million for the game’s development. In addition, over 800,000 individuals registered for the token sale, which Immutable claimed was an “oversubscription” of 82 times vs. the expected demand. It is being developed by Mineloader, which is the same company that created the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Gods Unchained creator Immutable is publishing the game. According to the game’s roadmap, it is expected to be released in open beta sometime in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Guild of Guardians documents state that it will be a free-to-play and play-to-earn mobile game. Players will not need to make any purchases to begin playing the game and start earning nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or game tokens. To finance the game’s further development after launch, Immutable will sell “seasonal content” consisting of limited edition NFTs, including “heroes, pets, guilds and energy boosters.” They will also charge a percentage fee on secondary sales of some of the game’s items. The play-to-earn aspect of Guild of Guardians will revolve around crafting equipment and summoning heroes. Players will be able to earn crafting materials as they progress through dungeons, which they’ll be able to use to mint NFTs that represent gear. They’ll also be able to collect “common” heroes that can be combined into higher rarities and minted on the blockchain. Guild of Guardians NFTs are minted on the Immutable X network, while the GOG token is on Ethereum. Ever since the fundraise, details about the state of the game’s development have been scarce. But Immutable invited members of the media to playtest the game From Oct. 9 to 20, and this writer was one of the persons invited. Guild of Guardians is designed entirely for mobile. You can play it on a mobile phone or tablet, and it’s available for both iOS and Android. But there’s no way currently to play it on a PC or console, and the team doesn’t appear to be planning to make a PC version anytime soon, if ever. The controls of the game are optimized for mobile gameplay, as the battles are mostly automated, with very little real-time control during fights. Related: What is Gods Unchained, and how to play it. In the Guild of Guardians docs, the team emphasized that mobile games are more accessible than any other type of video game. The number of people in the world who own smartphones is much greater than the number who own PCs, which is why they chose to make Guild of Guardians strictly a mobile game with touch-screen controls. Guild of Guardians is a classic “dungeon-crawl” game. The main gameplay consists of progressing through various dungeons, fighting monsters and opening treasure chests for loot. Players can choose which dungeon to explore by clicking on it from within an in-game world map. Once a dungeon is chosen, the player’s party of heroes loads into the first room, which usually contains monsters that can be fought. After each room is cleared, the player can choose which room to go to next. Different rooms contain different enemy strengths and rewards, and the player is presented with these metrics when making the decision. Some rooms contain treasure chests, healing or other boosts that may help the party to progress. Once a player progresses through all of the choices and defeats all the monsters, the dungeon ends. In this case, the main menu pops back up, and the heroes who died in the dungeon are resurrected. If all party members die before the dungeon is completed, the player fails the dungeon. However, they still get to keep the items they acquired from their partial completion. New dungeons become unlocked as old ones are completed. If the player completes all of the dungeons, they unlock a new “infinite” mode. This mode apparently allows a player to play through never-ending randomly generated dungeons for even more loot. I unfortunately didn’t make it far enough to test out infinite mode. The game has mostly automated battles. To start a battle, the player clicks on a “fight” button and watches the fight play out. They can choose to activate characters’ ultimate abilities manually, in which case there is some interaction during battles. However, they can also choose to have these abilities activated automatically, making the battles a completely passive experience. The challenge to winning a battle comes from decisions made before it begins. Before entering a dungeon, the player chooses which heroes to put into a party. Each hero has different abilities. Some are tanks or healers, while others are focused on damage-dealing. To succeed, the player needs to create a party out of characters whose abilities complement each other. In addition, characters can be placed in various positions within the party’s formation before a battle begins. Tanks should go in the front, while ranged damage dealers and healers should be placed in the back. Players also influence their ability to win by deciding which gear to outfit their characters with. I found that the battles were pretty balanced in terms of difficulty. My party cleaved its way through lots of small trash packs with ease, while there were a few bosses that slaughtered them without mercy. I was happy to see that heroes are automatically resurrected after a dungeon failure. Two of the most important goals in Guild of Guardians are to collect heroes and craft equipment. To get a new hero, the player must obtain a “summon,” which allows them to roll for a randomly selected hero. There seems to be a wide variety of heroes that can be collected, each with different artwork, ultimate abilities and stats. Some of the “summons” can be obtained as rewards for exploring dungeons, while a certain number are also given out as login rewards. Players get two heroes in the tutorial: one tank and one healer. I found that the hero-collecting system was a pretty satisfying reward mechanic. The heroes had a lot of variety in terms of stats and abilities, which made getting a new hero feel significant. To craft gear, the player needs to collect crafting materials within dungeons. I crafted a single item throughout my playtest sessions but couldn’t gain more experience than that. The game’s documents state that gear items differ in terms of rarity, with more rare items requiring more rare materials to craft. Different pieces of crafted gear provide different unique buffs; some items are parts of sets that give bigger bonuses if a character wears more than one piece from the set, the documents stated. Related: Game review: Axie Infinity currently rules the Pay-to-Win-to-Earn roost The Guild of Guardians demo that I played was an early version of the game. The public release will likely have more features and content. But so far, the game’s development seems to be on the right track. The battles are challenging, and there are a variety of strategic decisions the player has to make in order to succeed. This is not a run-of-the-mill play-to-earn game featuring mindless grinding for cryptocurrency. The gameplay is engaging and requires significant thought from the player. Fans of turn-based RPGs may enjoy Guild of Guardians, as it scratches their itch for strategic challenges. On the other hand, players who are looking for Diablo-style real-time action may want to pass over Guild of Guardians when it’s released. The battles in the game are almost entirely automated, so there’s no test of reflexes in this particular dungeon-crawler.

    "title": "Blockchain embraces gold to provide stability and growth for crypto assets",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-embraces-gold-to-provide-stability-and-growth-for-crypto-assets",
    "fullContent": "This project brings 250 years of expertise in gold to the blockchain to provide a stable entry into the crypto market.\nAs people look for a stable way to enter into the crypto market, this gold-backed digital ecosystem with a crypto token and NFTs offers a solution. Gold, a precious metal known for its scarcity and durability, has been the primary store of value since ancient civilizations. For thousands of years, people prized gold in their trades and investments. Even in the modern world, gold reserves are a major indicator of how strong and reliable a country’s economy is. Despite the gold standard being largely abandoned in 1971, governments and central banks worldwide still hold thousands of tonnes of gold in their reserves as a backup, showing that old habits die hard. In the era of cryptocurrency, a digital form of gold has emerged. Blockchain technology has enabled the proving and tracing of digital ownership of any asset transparently, paving the way for gold reserves to be digitized and represented by gold-backed tokens. Just like how stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, gold-backed tokens are also pegged to the real-time price of gold. Offering stability for users who want to hedge against both inflation and the volatility of the crypto market, gold-backed crypto tokens also simplify and democratize investments in gold by making it globally accessible. The potential of gold-backed crypto tokens accelerates traditional gold companies’ jump into Web3. International Precious Metals (IPM), a team of precious metals specialists with over 250 years of combined industry experience, announced that they are bringing their gold expertise to the crypto market with the launch of the gold-backed International Precious Metals Bullion (IPMB) coin and the accompanying Globally exchanged Metal (GeM) nonfungible token (NFT). Operating under environmental, social and governance (ESG) compliance, IPM has built a process traceable from the mining of gold to the minting of gold-backed tokens on the blockchain, resulting in a vertically-integrated coin. IPMB represents 1 gram of physical gold. Each IPMB is backed by unallocated investment-grade gold held in listed recognized vaults, including Brinks or Sharps Pixley. IPMB vaulted stocks are audited by Grant Thornton, one of the largest audit, tax and advisory firms.  The IPMB utility token allows holders to benefit from the stability of physical gold without the need to store and secure physical gold bars. IPMB holders have direct access to the underlying asset with the security of 100% physical gold backing while eliminating the management costs and counterparty risks associated with gold-based traditional finance products. Users can store IPMB tokens on supported crypto wallets, with trading starting on the Changelly crypto exchange on Oct. 30. GeM NFT is a key pillar of the IPMB ecosystem that is backed by — and exchangeable into — traceable, sustainably produced pure gold bars. Each GeM token comes in varying sizes, representing different amounts of gold. Users who hold IPMB for a year are qualified for a 12% discount on switching to the GeM NFTs, which can be redeemed for physical gold. Highlighting the potential of the IPMB ecosystem as a safe, secure and trusted resource backed by gold, John Vakis, founder and CEO of IPM, said: “We are providing a community-based ecosystem where owners can have liquidity, save and earn on their holdings. The IPMB achieves this with full ESG compliance, product certification and international quality standards.” As the crypto market looks for stability to attract more users, gold-backed tokens hold immense potential to onboard users who have concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. With a secure and trusted ecosystem based on gold, IPM aims to utilize blockchain technology to build a bridge between the stability of traditional gold and the flexibility of digital tokens.

    "fullContent": "Uniswap announced it would start charging a swap fee of 15% from Oct. 17, evoking mixed reactions from the crypto community.\nWelcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week. The past week in DeFi was dominated by developments in the popular decentralized exchange platform Uniswap after it announced a 0.15% swap fee starting on Oct. 17, and an open-source hook on Uniswap generated controversy due to Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. In other major DeFi developments, Platypus Finance managed to recover 90% of the funds it lost to an Oct. 12 exploit while the layer-2 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) “Scroll” launched its mainnet. The top 100 DeFi tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week thanks to Friday momentum in the market, with a majority of the tokens trading in green and recording double-digit gains on the weekly charts. However, the price action didn’t reflect on the total value locked (TVL), which fell by nearly $2 billion. The Ethereum liquid staking derivatives finance (LSDFi) ecosystem has seen a surge in growth this year as Ether (ETH) holders chose to stake rather than liquidate. Despite ETH withdrawals being enabled with the Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April 2023, an Oct. 16 LSDFi report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko said the sector has grown by 58.7x since January. By August 2023, LSD protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked, with Lido having the lion’s share at almost a third of the total staked market. Continue reading Scroll, a new contender in the zkEVM space that works to scale the blockchain, has confirmed the launch of its mainnet. The team behind Scroll announced the launch in an Oct. 17 post and added that existing applications and developer tool kits on Ethereum can now migrate to the new scaling solution. “Everything functions right out of the box,” the Scroll team said. Continue reading DeFi protocol Platypus Finance said it had recovered 90% of assets stolen in a security breach last week. According to the Oct. 17 announcement, the protocol’s net loss was limited to 18,000 Avalanche (AVAX) worth $167,400 at the time. As the hacker voluntarily returned the funds, Platypus Finance stated it “will guarantee that no legal action will be pursued.” It also hinted that withdrawal information regarding users’ assets will soon be posted. Continue reading Decentralized exchange Uniswap began charging a 0.15% swap fee on certain tokens in its web application and wallet on Oct. 17. According to a post by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, the affected tokens are ETH, USD Coin (USDC), Wrapped Ether (wETH), Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Angle Protocol’s agEUR, Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Euro Coin (EUROC) and StraitsX Singapore Dollar (XSGD). Shortly after publication, a spokesperson for Uniswap reached out to Cointelegraph, stating that “both the input and output token need to be on the list for the fee to apply.” Continue reading A new hook available on an open-source directory for Uniswap v4 hooks is sparking controversy within the crypto community. The hook enables users to be checked for KYC before they can trade in token pools. Criticizing the hook, a user on X (formerly Twitter) noted that the hook opens up the possibility of decentralized finance protocols being whitelisted by regulators. Continue reading Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that DeFi’s top 100 tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week, with most tokens trading in the green on weekly charts. However, the total value locked into DeFi protocols dropped to $43.81 billion. Thanks for reading our summary of this week’s most impactful DeFi developments.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-play-to-earn-game-offers-nfts-linked-to-physical-items-like-gold",
    "fullContent": "The days of wasting hundreds of hours on a game and receiving almost nothing in return are over — and it\u0027s all thanks to NFTs and blockchain technology.\nBlockchain gaming is going from strength to strength — underpinned by the explosion of nonfungible tokens, which continue to achieve mainstream adoption. The FRUITS Eco-Blockchain Project is building on this momentum by allowing NFTs to be redeemed for a coveted, real-world object: a physical golden egg. First came the console, then the humble PC. Smartphones soon came along and transformed the entertainment industry entirely — making games free to play, and putting them in the hands of consumers in emerging economies. Now, blockchain technology and nonfungible tokens (NFT) are ushering in the next wave of innovation. Once, in-game assets couldn\u0027t be transported from one title to another, traded freely with others, and sold on secondary markets. Web3 makes this possible — all while allowing avid players to receive recognition and rewards in exchange for their time. The days of wasting hundreds of hours on a game and getting almost nothing in return are coming to an end. Of course, some hurdles need to be overcome first. A 2022 report released by the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) showed that industry professionals found poor gameplay and complex onboarding as the main challenges that hinder mass adoption. Gamers deserve an easy-to-use interface with fun storylines and interesting avatars. The experience also needs to be beyond monetization — ensuring there\u0027s much more on offer than NFTs. That\u0027s where the FRUITS Eco-Blockchain Project comes in. It has launched a new title that aims to take play-to-earn gaming to the next level by allowing users to win free gold eggs by getting involved. Golden Egg Wonderland starts off with the story of a painter called Turtlen, who created vibrant artwork of birds and dreamed of one that could lay a golden egg. Suddenly, one of his drawings came to life. In this game, users have the chance to raise their own \"turtori\" — and make a collection that can crossbreed with one another. The higher rarity and status Turtori have a higher chance to lay golden egg NFTs, and in a novel development, gamers can redeem this for a real-world equivalent. Each character has been illustrated by an artist called Kamerian. — an up-and-coming star. To start playing the game, players should set up a FRUITS Wallet. Aside from giving them access to gameplay, the FRUITS Wallet also allows players to purchase FRTS Coins. These coins can be exchanged for blue diamonds which boost gamers’ chances of getting higher rarity birds. The higher the rarity and status of the birds, the higher the chance that they lay a golden egg, and the higher the chance it’s bigger. All of this comes as interest in gold continues to grow following high levels of inflation around the world — eroding the earnings of everyday consumers.  Golden Egg Wonderland’s developers believe that if their project is successful, it has the potential to usher in the wave of a new gold market. Gold is notoriously difficult to carry and transport, but NFTs backed by this precious metal can be owned, bought, sold, exchanged and redeemed in a digital setting. Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to be used to determine how many golden eggs will be issued in the game every month, based on the amount of gold that\u0027s been generated in the real world. Every coveted Golden Egg NFT will also be assigned a unique serial number for maximum transparency and security. This adds a fascinating economic element to the game and opens the door to blurring the lines between the game and the real world — all connected through the blockchain. The team behind Golden Egg Wonderland is hoping to make a splash on the world stage — opening a booth at Tokyo\u0027s Blockchain Expo on October 25. And in time, the project plans to collaborate with a plethora of famous fighters, athletes, artists and musicians to champion the \"turtori\" project. Disclaimer.

    "fullContent": "Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, has completed restructuring to focus on its upcoming metaverse project, Otherside.\nYuga Labs, the company behind the major nonfungible token (NFT) project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has completed restructuring amid the ongoing challenges in the industry. Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre took to X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 17 to report that the company has finalized its restructuring, which was announced in early October. “We now begin the task of refining the focus with our new team configurations,” Alegre said, reiterating that the company will prioritize the execution of Otherside, a gamified and interoperable metaverse project that Yuga started in March 2022. Alegre emphasized that building an “immersive metaverse” platform is hard both technically and creatively, adding: Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano previously announced the company’s restructuring on Oct. 6, stating that Yuga “needed to make some changes” in order to ensure that it’s set up for long-term success. “With this reorg, Yuga is still over 120 employees, and is focused on specific priorities,” Solano said. He didn’t specify how many people had to leave Yuga Labs as part of the restructuring. Alegre also assured that his top priority during restructuring was to “ensure that those leaving Yuga are treated with the respect and gratitude they deserve.” He claimed that Yuga’s transition package included “generous severance,” the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act coverage and assistance in finding new job opportunities. The CEO added: Yuga Labs did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Related: Microsoft’s Activision buy may see more metaverse in the office and crypto in gaming The news comes amid a U.S. appeals court on Oct. 16 expressing skepticism about an attempt to dismiss Yuga Labs’ trademark lawsuit against artist Ryder Ripps over his copies of Yuga’s BAYC NFTs. Previously, a group of BAYC investors filed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs and fine arts auction house Sotheby’s in August 2023, alleging that the auction house helped Yuga Labs “deceptively promote” the NFT collection.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/gamers-can-now-explore-mars-in-tesla-inspired-cybertrucks-heres-how",
    "fullContent": "The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, was once a landscape only scientists could examine. But now, a topographically accurate game opens the red planet up to the masses.\nThe Web3 game Mars4, which allows players to explore the surface of Mars, has unveiled two new exclusive rovers inspired by Tesla\u0027s Cybertrucks. For decades, space enthusiasts have had a fascination with Mars. NASA\u0027s Perseverance rover is giving us regular insight on what life is like some 140 million miles away — with footage recently capturing a rare weather phenomenon known as a dust devil. There are so many unanswered questions. Has life ever existed on this planet? Were there once friendly conditions where species could thrive? What are the hurdles that stand in the way of human and robotic exploration? In the past, understanding Mars has been an opportunity only reserved for scientists. But huge technological transformations — such as virtual reality (VR) — now offer ordinary people the chance to get up close and personal to an environment so divorced from our own. NASA data has paved the way for detailed 3D maps of the terrain on Mars to be created. Now, all of this topography has been transformed into a game where everyone can play and interact in an accurate Martian landscape where they must battle to survive.  Mars4 is an AAA 3D game that\u0027s been built using the Unreal Engine 5.1, a game engine made by Epic Games. Players have the chance to own a piece of land on the red planet, with each offering a distinctive environment. According to this play-to-earn game, more than 60,000 plots have already been sold. From here, the goal of the title is simple: explore, expand your land, construct dream buildings, gather resources, establish a colony, and create value. While it may be an unforgiving and harsh atmosphere, establishing a fully-fledged habitat creates a better chance of survival — and any resources found can be traded with fellow explorers. New features are continually being added — with two rovers inspired by Tesla Cybertrucks, Phobos X and Deimos X, recently introduced. Both are only available for a limited time only and are low in quantity, meaning there\u0027s likely to be fierce competition for these in-game assets. According to Mars4, this is a fitting tribute given how the project was inspired by the electric vehicle manufacturer.  And that\u0027s not all. A robotic pet called Bullionaire has also been launched — giving colonists a helping hand and additional inventory space. Meanwhile, a new decoration set allows players to add a few homely touches to their properties. Whereas other games suffer from limited levels, a lack of land to explore and unrelatable storylines, Mars4 says it has something for everyone. Now, intrepid adventurers can build a new world from the ground up, go where no player has gone before, and be the first to make exciting discoveries about the surface of the red planet. Beyond its entertainment value, this title has the potential to be truly educational — a game that parents wouldn\u0027t mind their kids spending hours on. Mars4 is continually looking to break new ground and add further enhancements — over the summer, players could take to the skies in jetpacks, with an Alpha 1 sandbox released to test multiplayer functionality. All this, when coupled with regular ask-me-anything sessions and AI-generated art competitions that shed Mars in a new light, serve as the building blocks for forming a vibrant, outward-looking new community.

    "fullContent": "The staff note suggested that, although the DeFi ecosystem brings a ton of innovations in the financial sector, the regulatory challenges and vulnerability limit its potential use in traditional finance.\nThe Bank of Canada published a staff note on decentralized finance (DeFi) on Oct. 17, assessing the innovations that made it popular and the challenges and risks associated with its use. The staff note described DeFi as a multi-layered structure, with the Ethereum blockchain serving as the bottom layer (or settlement layer). Developers construct a variety of tools and services on top of the main blockchain, including tokenization, lending and borrowing services, and much more. The staff note shed light on the rise in popularity of the DeFi ecosystem starting in 2020 and how it became an integral part of the crypto economy, with billions in volume over the next few years. The popularity of the ecosystem took a dip starting in 2022 with the collapse of multiple key crypto platforms with significant DeFi exposure, including Terra. Talking about the key features of the decentralized ecosystem, the staff note lauded DeFi’s “composability,” which allows the apps and services in the ecosystem to interconnect. The Bank of Canada note highlighted three of the key areas where DeFi can transform the financial system: Apart from the key DeFi innovations that can transform the traditional financial system, the staff note also talked about the challenges and risks associated with the DeFi ecosystem, claiming that “despite its innovations and possibilities, the overall economic benefits of DeFi remain limited.” Related: Bank of Canada emphasizes need for stablecoin regulation as legislation is tabled The note lists three key challenges that the DeFi system faces today: the lack of real-world tokenization, the higher concentration of interconnection within, and its dependence on the unregulated centralized finance ecosystem. The note also highlighted the regulatory challenges posed by the DeFi ecosystem and the rise in vulnerabilities in the ecosystem, leading to several hacks and exploits. The note claimed that “the anonymous and borderless nature of public blockchains complicates regulatory oversight.” Magazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/appeals-court-judges-skeptical-ryder-ripps-bored-ape-appeal",
    "fullContent": "The lawyer representing Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen struggled to convince a panel of judges that Yuga Labs’ case against his clients should be thrown out under California’s anti-SLAPP statute.\nNonfungible token (NFT) artist Ryder Ripps’ most recent attempt to dismiss the Bored Ape Yacht Club-related lawsuit against him appears to have fallen on skeptical ears. In an Oct. 16 hearing, three judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District appeared largely unpersuaded by the arguments from the attorney representing Ripps and Jeremy Cahen (known by the pseudonym “Pauly” on X), who argued the case should have been dismissed on the grounds of free speech. Ripps and Cahen’s lawyer, WilmerHale partner Thomas Sprankling, argued the knock-off Bored Ape NFTs were sold and distributed in a way that protested the supposedly anti-semitic imagery hidden within the Yuga Labs-created collection. He repeatedly positioned Ripps and Cahen as selling the NFTs as an avant-garde exercise that pushes the boundaries of speech and claimed Yuga’s suit should have been thrown out under a California law that aims to stop intimidatory lawsuits, known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP. Sprankling told the judges that the anti-SLAPP statute is designed as a “prophylactic” — meaning that it is supposed to go “a little beyond the bounds of the First Amendment to make sure you’re not threatening people with chilling speech in litigation, as is the case that happened here.” In their anti-SLAPP motion, the pair asserted that Yuga Labs only initiated the lawsuit against them to silence their “protest” art and drown them in legal costs. However, the judges seemed interested only in the secondary sales of the NFTs themselves, essentially dismissing all arguments that hinged on any artistic criticism. “He was selling the same images, on the same marketplaces, on virtually indistinguishable NFT identifiers,” said Judge Anthony Johnstone in response to Sprankling’s argument. “I’m still not seeing it,” added Judge Morgan Christen. Related: NFT market slump shows it’s maturing toward ‘genuine utility,’ execs argue Yuga Labs first filed a complaint against Ripps and Cahen in July 2022, alleging the pair made millions of dollars while engaging in trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition following the release of a derivative NFT collection called RR/BAYC. On April 21, a California District Court found that Ripps and Cahen had infringed Yuga Lab’s trademarks with their RR/BAYC NFT collection. While Californian District Court Judge John Walter has already held a bench trial to assess the scope of damages to be paid to Yuga Labs, he has yet to announce the case’s conclusion.

    "fullContent": "Decentraland Foundation executive director Yemel Jardis believes as people become more educated about NFTs, the focus will shift from speculative trading to genuine utility.\nA steep collapse in the price of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) shouldn’t be seen as a sign of distress but rather a signal the technology is maturing, according to Web3 executives. “I wouldn’t say the NFT market has regressed,“ Decentraland Foundation executive director Yemel Jardi told Cointelegraph. “Rather, it’s maturing.\" Jardi’s comments come after a September report from dappGambl that analyzed over 73,000 NFT collections and concluded that as much as 95% of the NFTs studied had no value, as prices, sales volume and transactions have slid over the past year. Jardi stressed that markets are cyclic and it is natural for there to be periods of adjustment. He attributed sliding NFT floor prices partly to “speculative trading” and said the value of NFTs should instead be anchored to their utility. Anjali Young, co-founder of the tokenized community-management platform Collab.Land, isn’t surprised about the anti-NFT sentiment either. “Any innovation — especially this one with financial impact, cultural value and status — will attract questioning during its downs,” she said. Young believes many projects have stumbled since marketplaces such as OpenSea removed mandated royalty fees in late August. Despite this, Young claimed that NFTs are “here to stay” and expects they will be more frequently used for loyalty programs, rewards, advertising and proof of authenticity in the coming months. They\u0027ve left us all for dead, saying 95% of NFTs are worthless. But the truth is very, very different. Look no further than car companies and their adoption of NFT tech ️ From collectibles to supply chains, perhaps no industry is more bullish on Web3. A short thread Tama Churchouse, chief operating officer of Cumberland Labs, recently opined that NFTs aren’t “dead,” arguing that recent developments in the space show there are still signs of life. While the NFT market has primarily been dominated by digital art, Jardi said that nonfungible tokens remain an important tool for the broader digital landscape, as ownership of tangible assets can be denoted to users in novel ways. Wow, someone just listed a $26.5 million building in one of New York City\u0027s most prestigious areas as an #nft. Handling property rights through NFTs is a very exciting use case to cut out the middle men. #realestate #nfts #NFTCommunity #nftcollector pic.twitter.com/PowOwwMZsb Jardi believes governments and institutions will leverage NFTs in the future for various use cases. On Oct. 9, the Chinese-state-owned newspaper China Daily announced plans to launch a platform for trading digital collectibles. Related: Mainstream NFT adoption will be driven mostly by their utility The entertainment sector is another huge market for the NFT industry to capture, according to Scott Lawin, CEO of sports token platform Candy Digital. Lawin told Cointelegraph that 24% of Major League Baseball fans who entered stadiums with mobile tickets in 2022 redeemed their complimentary commemorative digital ticket provided by Candy as a form of memorabilia. “Those are all utilities of NFTs in real time,” Lawin added. On the brand side, Adidas, Bud Light, Gucci, Prada and other companies dipping into the NFT space have seen a recent uptick in the number of active users on their Discord channels, Young said. The NFT market capitalization currently stands at $5 billion, according to data from Forbes Digital Assets. The Yuga Labs-owned CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club collections are the two largest, with market caps of $710 million and $400 million, respectively.

    "fullContent": "The market for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) might be struggling during this \"NFT Winter,\" but there are signs of life if you know where to look.\nHeadlines predicting the death of Bitcoin are nothing new. Over the past decade, we’ve seen every permutation of why “Bitcoin is dead” imaginable, yet the current crypto winter has brought very few of these dire proclamations. It seems a little different this time. Maybe it’s hard to pen such a eulogy with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $28,000, and a spot Bitcoin ETF on the horizon. Doesn’t seem like Ethereum’s dead either. But the blockchain industry and its commentators still need a corpse to poke at, and that’s what they’ve found with the putrid cadaver that is the nonfungible token (NFT) market. Related: The economy is surging — which means it might be time to start buying Bitcoin NFTs are dead. Deceased. Lifeless. NFTs are the “Norwegian Blue” from Monty Python’s Dead Parrot Sketch. And the grave dancing has commenced; to quote a recent Rolling Stone headline, “Your NFTs are actually — finally — totally worthless.” Rolling Stone is right — most NFTs are indeed utterly worthless. Yet that should not be surprising to anyone who’s been in crypto for a few cycles. Most of the ICO tokens from the 2017 bull market vintage were dead by the 2018/19 winter. Likewise, the countless DeFi protocol tokens post-DeFi-summer of 2020. Today, more than 1.8 million tokens have an aggregate market cap of a little more than $1 trillion. But the top 10 largest protocols and tokens account for over 93% of the total. Do the math. That’s a long, long tail of worthless zombie coins. The vast majority of all tokens die. So why should NFTs be any different? The barrier to entry to create an NFT project in the hope of striking it rich was (and remains) low. Anyone can, and seemingly did, create an NFT collection in a few minutes with a few keystrokes. Related: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto So what happened when a frenzy of trading activity and money flooded into this new corner of the crypto market in mid-2021? The free market responded exactly how it was supposed to: it provided supply. And supply ≠ quality, especially in this industry. We’ve seen the same cycle again and again, this just happens to be the first real NFT winter. A-listers have quietly taken their NFT Twitter avatars down. Jimmy Fallon isn’t shilling apes with Paris Hilton on late-night TV. Ashton Kutcher’s Stoner Cats has settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A collective sense of embarrassment abounds. NFT trading volumes have collapsed, from around $1 billion a week in mid-2021 to early-2022, to sub-$100 million today. It’s bleak. But, as I said back in October 2021 about NFTs, “Peaks and troughs are nothing new, it\u0027s what emerges from them which is what\u0027s worth paying attention to.” For those curious and open-minded enough to look beneath the surface of the “NFTs are dead” generalization prevalent today, there are signs of life amidst the rubble. In September, news emerged that PayPal filed a patent application in March surrounding an NFT purchase-and-transfer system. Pudgy Penguins continues to expand into physical toys, first selling on Amazon in March and recently expanding to 2,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. (Disclaimer: I own a fat penguin jpeg.) Doodles have collaborated with casual footwear brand Crocs in a similar effort to merge the physical and digital, with a likewise similar collaboration between Gary Vee’s Veefriends and Reebok. At a concert over the summer, Harry Styles fans could download an app featuring a self-custodial digital wallet for future NFT rewards. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber is collaborating with a blockchain music platform to turn a song into an NFT with royalty streams to the NFT holders. The top auction houses continue to bring mainstream artists into the NFT world, Keith Haring with Christies for example, and Sotheby’s partnering with Ledger to offer a co-branded Ledger Nano X (hardware wallet) for buyers of premier digital art. If you keep looking you’ll find more and more signs of life, because NFTs are not “dead.” The fundamental technological primitive of what NFTs are and what they offer will not “die,” any more than blockchain will “die.” They will simply continue to evolve while the weak hands, weak teams, scams, copycats, and fast money fade into history, another footnote from another crypto cycle. As we transition from this NFT winter into a new season, expect to see NFT projects that are more sophisticated and commercially viable, enriching the ecosystem in new and meaningful ways.

Tornado Cash is famous for its popularity among scammers seeking to wash their funds. In August 2023, the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) even announced sanctions against the crypto mixer for its alleged role in laundering crime proceeds. However, these sanctions couldn’t completely cut off the mixer’s usage. For example, in July 2023, almost $60 million in Ether, stolen from the AnubisDAO two years earlier, was moved via Tornado Cash. The person possessing the 13,556 ETH divided and transferred the funds into 100 ETH transactions.",

Over $100 million was lost in July when the China-based Multichain protocol drained all of its users’ funds into an attacker’s account. The team alleges that police have arrested their CEO, but victims are still searching for answers as to what happened to their funds and how they can be reimbursed.",

    "fullContent": "Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre said the firm was stretching itself thin by taking on too many projects and will now focus on its core aims with a smaller team.\nBored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs has announced a restructuring that has seen several roles “eliminated across the company.” The exact number of layoffs hasn’t been specified; however, in an Oct. 6 blog post shared via X (formerly Twitter), Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre suggested the firm had taken on too many projects that were ultimately distracting it from its “core priorities.” Yuga Labs is announcing a restructuring that will better focus our team on our core priorities. While certain roles have been impacted, these changes are necessary to evolve as an organization. For more see a note written by @dalegre on our https://t.co/722YfqwaCB official blog. “I realized very quickly that there were a number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies,” he said, adding that: Moving forward, Alegre outlined that the firm will ramp up its focus on community building, “going all-in” on its Otherside metaverse project and securing brand partnerships. Nike’s Web3 unit .Swoosh has unveiled its first physical sneaker line called the Air Force 1 Low Tinaj. The sneakers contain a mixture of white and black panels and feature blue .Swoosh logos. As per an Oct. 5 announcement on X, the sneakers will only be available to .Swoosh members who purchase and open at least one OF1 Box nonfungible token (NFT) before the Oct. 16 deadline. Meet the newest member of the .SWOOSH family, TINAJ Our first ever physical sneaker is here! Well…almost here. pic.twitter.com/jHNZBhqbtz The OF1 Boxes cost $120 a pop and are available on the .Swoosh website. The catch, however, is that not everyone who opens the boxes can get their hands on these shoes. The .Swoosh team noted on X that there is only a limited supply and did not specify the exact numbers available. Those who open OF1 Boxes that don’t offer access to the Tinaj shoes are likely to receive other benefits and access to other drops down the line. .@rothisrad https://t.co/VRltVWT3rr Surging NFT trading volume on the gaming-focused Mythos Chain has seen the network surpass Polygon and Solana to become the second-largest blockchain in terms of NFT sales volume over the past 30 days.
