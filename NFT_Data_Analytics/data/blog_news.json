    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK The Sandbox has launched its NFT marketplace on the Polygon network, making it more accessible and cost-effective for users. Users can now mint digital assets using CATALYSTs on this new platform, democratizing the NFT creation process. The introduction of a secondary market allows for the resale of ASSETs, broadening trading and monetization opportunities. The Sandbox, a prominent player in the world of NFTs and virtual metaverse creation, has taken a significant stride towards enhancing accessibility and reducing costs for creators and users. The latest development sees the launch of The Sandbox Marketplace on Polygon, a move that promises to reshape the NFT landscape. One of the most notable features of this launch is the ability for anyone to mint their digital assets (ASSETs) on the Polygon marketplace using CATALYSTs. This democratizes the NFT creation process, making it accessible to a broader audience. Notably, Polygon’s network significantly reduces transaction fees, addressing a long-standing concern in the NFT space. Furthermore, The Sandbox introduces a secondary market, allowing NFT owners to resell ASSETs that they didn’t originally create on the platform. This opens up new avenues for trading and monetizing digital collectibles. For those already holding CATALYSTs, minting on the Polygon marketplace becomes readily accessible. But what if you don’t have CATALYSTs yet? The Sandbox plans to distribute CATALYSTs to ecosystem contributors, including LAND owners, as part of their commitment to expanding opportunities for creators. Existing ASSET holders need not worry about the fate of their assets. Minted assets on the Ethereum chain will remain usable and can be bridged to the Polygon layer in the future. Non-minted assets, like equipment, will be migrated to align with the new structure, ensuring a smooth transition for users. Gas fees have long been a concern for NFT enthusiasts, but The Sandbox addresses this by significantly reducing fees on the Polygon marketplace. Additionally, they cover a portion of Polygon transaction fees for users across their ecosystem, enhancing affordability. The user interface of the marketplace has undergone a revamp, with improved asset upload flows, asset moderation, and an enhanced user experience. This ensures a seamless and efficient trading experience for users. To buy your first NFT on Polygon via The Sandbox Marketplace, you need to log in, connect your wallet to the Polygon network, browse the marketplace, select your desired NFT, and complete the purchase. The process is streamlined, making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned collectors. As The Sandbox expands its metaverse and NFT offerings, creators are encouraged to participate in VoxEdit contests and contribute to the vibrant community. The launch of the new marketplace also comes with a captivating collection from 30 talented artists, adding to the diversity of available ASSETs. The Sandbox’s move to launch its marketplace on Polygon opens up exciting opportunities for creators and collectors alike. With reduced fees, improved user experience, and a commitment to accessibility, it marks a significant step forward in the ever-evolving world of NFTs.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Immortal Game, a popular blockchain chess game, has announced the closure of its play-to-earn and NFT features. The decision was driven by widespread cheating, undermining the game’s integrity and player experience. This move has significantly impacted the play-to-earn gaming community and NFT market. Developers of the popular blockchain chess game Immortal Game have announced a significant decision that is sending shockwaves through the world of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In a surprising move, the creators have decided to shut down the P2E and NFT features of the Game due to a growing problem of rampant cheating. This move, announced on December 13, has left the gaming community in awe as Immortal Game was initially hailed as a pioneering platform aiming to provide players with a legitimate opportunity to earn income through chess. However, their noble intentions have backfired, leading to an influx of unfair practices and cheating within the Game. The root of the problem is the large sums of cash rewards offered with no entry barriers, which inadvertently encouraged players to exploit the system. In their announcement, immortal Game’s developers noted that this situation degraded the experience for genuine players who sought a fair and secure environment to enjoy online chess. Starting immediately, the marketplace for Immortal Game NFTs will be discontinued, and players will no longer be able to use the native P2E Checkmate token (CMT) within the Game. While NFTs will continue on the blockchain, users will no longer receive CMT rewards for participating in tournaments or daily challenges. Instead, fiat currency rewards may be introduced as an alternative. In a further adjustment, users will no longer see their ETH and CMT balances displayed on the platform, although these tokens will remain in their wallets. Those using custodial wallets must connect a personal wallet to facilitate asset transfers. Before its discontinuation, Immortal Game NFTs had amassed a lifetime trading volume of $885,600, while the CMT token boasted a fully diluted market capitalization of $360,075. These NFTs were minted on the Immutable blockchain, adding to the gaming landscape. This decision by Immortal Game’s developers marks a turning point in the P2E and NFT gaming industry, as it highlights the challenges and pitfalls associated with offering substantial financial incentives to players. It remains to be seen whether other projects in the space will follow suit or find innovative solutions to combat cheating while maintaining the allure of play-to-earn gaming.",

FIFA, the international governing body for soccer, has announced its foray into the world of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), with an exclusive collection set to premiere just ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia. In collaboration with blockchain firm Modex, FIFA’s inaugural NFT collection promises to offer fans an exciting opportunity. The collection, scheduled to launch on December 15, will consist of 100 NFTs, each of which grants the lucky owner a chance to secure tickets to the FIFA World Cup 2026 final—an enticing prospect for soccer enthusiasts worldwide. Additionally, 900 digital collectibles will be issued on the Polygon network and OpenSea this month. These NFTs will feature memorable moments from the tournament and digital renditions of coveted memorabilia. The FIFA Club World Cup, commencing on December 12 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, will bring together seven of the world’s finest football teams, including champions from FIFA’s six confederations. Fans eager to acquire these NFTs can do so via FIFA’s dedicated platform, FIFA+ Collect, launched in September 2022 and operates on the Algorand blockchain. Digital collectibles have rapidly gained popularity among sports enthusiasts, offering novel ways for fans to engage with their favorite players, teams, and the beautiful game. Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex, expressed his enthusiasm, stating, “Digital collectibles increase how fans can interact with their favorite players, teams, and the game they love, and we’re honored to support FIFA in realizing this goal.” Since its inception, FIFA+ Collect has hosted 11 NFT drops, minting 909,255 digital collectibles held by 16,448 individuals. Notably, these NFTs have generated a trading volume of $2.4 million across primary and secondary NFT markets. FIFA+ Collect Info clarifies that the mint volume may include packs obtained through challenges rather than those purchased with USDC. This move by FIFA into the NFT space underscores the growing influence of blockchain technology in sports, offering fans unique opportunities to own digital pieces of soccer history while fostering a deeper connection with the sport they love. As the 2023 Club World Cup unfolds, the NFT world eagerly awaits the launch of this exclusive collection, setting a new precedent for the intersection of sports and blockchain technology.",

NFTs accessible through credit card or wETH, transferable on December 31, 2024; buyers must provide KYC information. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his third nonfungible token (NFT) drop, titled “MugShot,” which revolves around his ongoing legal troubles. These unique digital trading cards are available for $99 each, with an intriguing incentive for buyers who acquire 47 or more cards: the chance to own a piece of President Trump’s actual suit from his infamous mugshot and enjoy dinner at Mar-a-Lago with the former president himself. What sets this NFT collection apart is its connection to a significant historical moment. On August 24, 2023, Donald Trump was formally arrested in Fulton County, Georgia, marking the first-ever mugshot of a United States President. In the arresting photo, Trump sports a furrowed brow and a determined gaze, symbolizing his unwavering spirit with the caption, “he’ll never surrender.” This NFT drop is accessible through credit card payments or Wrapped Ether (wETH), but there’s a catch. These digital assets will be transferable on December 31, 2024. Additionally, buyers must provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information, even if they opt to use cryptocurrency for their purchase. The “MugShot” NFT collection follows Trump’s two successful NFT launches. Notably, the former First Lady Melania Trump has also ventured into the NFT space with her collection. Trump decided to release this NFT collection as he seeks a non-consecutive second term in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Currently facing 91 felony charges on allegations of business fraud and efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, it’s important to note that the U.S. Constitution does not automatically disqualify suspects or convicted individuals from running for federal office. Enforcing the 14th Amendment, which bars condemned insurrectionists from holding public office, would require congressional action. In the world of NFTs, where art and history intersect with digital innovation, President Trump’s “MugShot” drop adds another layer of intrigue and controversy, reflecting the ongoing narrative of his legal battles and political ambitions. This collection will draw attention and scrutiny as NFTs captivate the digital art world.",

Despite health challenges, Aronow actively observes Yuga Labs’ operations, identifying key issues and suggesting changes. NFT entrepreneur Wylie Aronow, co-founder of Yuga Labs, has officially addressed rumors about his potential return to the NFT firm. Despite making steady progress in his health recovery, Aronow has firmly stated that he is not yet ready to return, emphasizing the importance of ensuring his long-term well-being. Aronow, who also goes by the name Gordon Goner, had taken a leave of absence from Yuga Labs in late January due to a congestive heart failure diagnosis. At that time, he clarified that he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser to the company. In his recent statement, Aronow revealed the unpredictable nature of his health journey, describing days when he feels ready to dive back into work and others when he feels the need for immediate medical attention.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Starting July 2024, South Korea’s FSC will enable investors to earn interest on digital asset deposits in exchanges. The directive excludes nonfungible tokens and central bank digital currencies from earning interest. Exchanges must segregate user deposits, entrust them to banks, and store 80% of coins in cold wallets. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has issued a new directive that will impact digital asset investors and exchanges in the country. According to the FSC’s notice, starting from July 2024, investors who deposit their digital assets into exchanges will be entitled to receive interest on their deposits. This move is part of South Korea’s efforts to regulate the crypto space more comprehensively. However, there are exceptions to this new rule. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been excluded from the mandate. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs reflects the unique nature of these digital assets, which may not fit the criteria for interest-bearing deposits. Interestingly, the FSC has left room for potential exceptions to this exclusion. If certain NFTs are categorized as payment methods and are issued in significant quantities, they may be reclassified as virtual assets and become eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. This shows the regulator’s flexibility in adapting to the evolving landscape of digital assets. In addition to addressing interest on deposits, the FSC has also laid out guidelines for the safe handling of user deposits by virtual asset operators. Exchanges are now required to segregate user deposits from their own assets and entrust them to a bank. Furthermore, a substantial portion, specifically 80%, of the coins must be stored in a secure cold wallet, enhancing security measures. The FSC’s directive also covers preparations for potential hacks or computer incidents. Virtual asset service providers are mandated to either acquire insurance or accumulate reserves to mitigate the impact of such incidents. Additionally, the new law prohibits exchanges from blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it is deemed absolutely necessary and authorized by the courts or financial regulators. South Korea has been actively solidifying its regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier in December, financial regulators called on users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges operating within the country. This initiative was led by the Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea. As South Korea continues to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, these regulatory changes aim to strike a balance between investor protection and industry growth. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs, while allowing for potential exceptions, highlights the need for flexible and nuanced regulation in the world of cryptocurrencies.",

A substantial 125% increase in NFT trading activity occurred in November. The average transaction value of NFTs has significantly risen, indicating a growing market interest and value. In a compelling turn of events, the nonfungible token (NFT) market has experienced a robust surge in trading volume, approaching the $1 billion mark in November. DappRadar, a decentralized app tracking platform, released data revealing that NFT trading has embraced the bullish wave, marking the second consecutive month of upward momentum. The report from DappRadar indicates a remarkable 125% increase in NFT trading volume in November, signaling a significant shift in user behavior compared to previous downtrends in NFT activity. Notably, this surge comes amid a broader positive trend in the cryptocurrency markets. Executives within the Web3 space are optimistic about the continuation of this trend. Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of SuperRare, conveyed to Cointelegraph on November 14 that the worst of the bear market appears to be behind us, suggesting a favorable outlook for the NFT sector in the coming months. In addition to the surge in trading volume, the average value of NFT transactions experienced an impressive 114% increase, climbing from $126 to $270 throughout November. This indicates a growing confidence and willingness among participants to engage in higher-value transactions within the NFT space. DappRadar’s report also sheds light on the increased daily unique active wallets (UAW) in blockchain gaming, witnessing a 14% rise. The decentralized applications industry saw blockchain gaming with a 34% market dominance, reinforcing its status as a fundamental pillar in the decentralized ecosystem. Despite a seemingly bearish mood throughout the year, blockchain gaming projects have managed to secure a substantial $2.3 billion in investments from the beginning of 2023 up to October. This resilience is particularly evident in the third quarter of 2023, where blockchain gaming secured an impressive $600 million in investments, even amidst lower cryptocurrency market prices than previous peaks. In conclusion, the NFT market’s remarkable resurgence and the resilience of blockchain gaming investments paint a picture of a dynamic and evolving landscape within the cryptocurrency space. As the crypto markets turn bullish, these trends may signal a broader shift in user sentiment and behavior, marking a positive outlook for the industry in the months ahead.",

This initiative brings Reebok’s styles into the digital world as wearable NFTs and emphasizes creating immersive virtual gaming experiences. A critical project in this partnership is “Reebok Impact,” which is slated for launch next year. This initiative is described as a “mind and heart-bending digital shoe experience” that integrates AI technology with on-chain digital wearables. The goal is to illustrate that life’s essence is not just about the sneakers one wears but about one’s experiences while wearing them. Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky highlighted the importance of participating in the world purposefully, and this partnership with Futureverse is seen as a step towards redefining the limits of innovation and consumer engagement in the digital evolution of products. Futureverse, which secured $54 million in Series A funding in July, aims to create an “open metaverse” where digital assets like NFTs can move freely across multiple platforms. The company is expanding its ecosystem by acquiring other crypto firms, games, and metaverse experiences, although this collaboration with Reebok marks its first foray into digital footwear. In comparison, Nike acquired RTFKT, an NFT sneaker studio, in December 2021, leading the footwear industry into the virtual domain. Since then, Nike has built a robust NFT community and released exclusive physical sneaker collections with digital counterparts. Following this trend, brands like Adidas, Dior, and Puma have launched similar “phygital” products. While Reebok has not announced any plans for physical sneakers linked to digital tokens yet, it has revealed a limited-edition sneaker drop in collaboration with Gary Vaynerchuk’s NFT brand VeeFriends. This special edition will initially be available to VeeFriends token holders before being released globally. Reebok’s partnership with Futureverse represents a significant move into the digital realm, blending AI and blockchain technology to create unique gaming and digital fashion experiences, potentially reshaping how consumers interact with the brand in virtual spaces.",

This approach adds a tangible, personal touch to digital assets. Megadeth’s foray into NFTs mirrors a growing trend in the heavy metal genre.

Early responses suggest a positive outlook. Fans are eager to explore this new dimension of their favorite band. The combination of heavy metal and NFTs is a winning formula. Megadeth’s NFT venture reflects the evolving landscape of music and technology. It not only offers exclusive experiences but also empowers fans. As this trend grows, it could revolutionize how artists and fans connect. MegadethDigital is not just a collection; it’s a pioneering step into a future where music, art, and technology converge seamlessly.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Thirdweb, a provider of crypto development tools, has disclosed a significant vulnerability in their smart contracts, impacting the Ethereum NFT community. The issue affects pre-built contracts from Thirdweb, particularly concerning Ethereum’s ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-20 standards. OpenZeppelin, another smart contract library, confirmed that the vulnerability does not originate from their code but is helping to address the issue. In the dynamic world of Ethereum NFTs, a recent revelation about a vulnerability in Thirdweb’s smart contracts has sent ripples through the community. Thirdweb, known for its crypto development tools, disclosed a significant issue in a widely used open-source library for Web3 smart contracts. This discovery has prompted a swift response from Ethereum NFT marketplaces and creators, underscoring the urgency of securing digital assets. The vulnerability, which remains undisclosed to prevent exploitation, affects pre-built contracts provided by Thirdweb and potentially others. Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized apps and NFT collections, making this a critical concern for stakeholders. OpenZeppelin, another prominent player in smart contract libraries, clarified that the problem does not originate from its repository. Despite this, the company has committed to leading the community in identifying affected parties and offering mitigation strategies. IMPORTANT On November 20th, 2023 6pm PST, we became aware of a security vulnerability in a commonly used open-source library in the web3 industry. This impacts a variety of smart contracts across the web3 ecosystem, including some of thirdweb’s pre-built smart contracts.… — thirdweb (@thirdweb) December 5, 2023 In a proactive measure, Thirdweb advises projects to lock down their current smart contracts and transition to new ones, ensuring the safety of their collections. The firm has also pledged to support affected parties financially by covering the network fees for this migration. This recommendation comes after Thirdweb implemented a fix to its smart contract templates on November 22, ensuring that contracts deployed after this date are secure. The exploit impacts NFT smart contracts adhering to Ethereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and ERC-20 standard fungible tokens. Thirdweb’s blog post provides a detailed list of affected contract types and a tool for identifying compromised contracts. Several major industry players have weighed in on the situation. OpenSea and Rarible, leading NFT marketplaces, are exploring ways to assist collection owners with contract migrations. Coinbase revealed that some collections on its NFT platform are affected, while Manifold, a smart contract startup, confirmed its contracts are safe. Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network, acknowledged the impact on some project contracts but assured the network’s security. Ethereum profile picture project Cool Cats and Animoca Brands’ Mocaverse gaming platform are moving to new contracts to safeguard their NFT collections. In response to the challenge, Thirdweb has doubled its bug bounty payments to $50,000 and committed to a more stringent auditing process in the future. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in the rapidly evolving field of NFTs and the importance of robust security measures to protect digital assets in the decentralized space.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Tiger Global’s NFT portfolio slashes reflect crypto market caution amid volatility. Coatue Management marks down OpenSea investment by 90%, echoing NFT market reevaluation. The evolving NFT space prompts major investors to recalibrate, shaping crypto’s future stability. In a significant move, Tiger Global, a prominent investment firm, has drastically reduced its investments in notable non-fungible token (NFT) projects. These investments include the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection and the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Bloomberg’s recent report reveals that Tiger Global slashed its BAYC stakes by 69% and OpenSea holdings by 94%. Moreover, the firm has also cut valuations for several other portfolio companies. Tiger Global’s decision reflects a cautious approach towards the volatile crypto market. The firm has been diversifying its investments in the crypto realm, focusing on NFTs and blockchain security and privacy-focused initiatives. In 2021, it co-led a $24 million funding round for blockchain security company CertiK, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing decentralized finance (DeFi) security. Furthermore, in 2022, Tiger Global participated in a Series B investment for Aleo, a zero-knowledge applications platform, which successfully raised $200 million. This round saw leading investors like Kora Management LP and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Additionally, the firm invested in Polygon, a layer-2 network, showcasing its broad interest in crypto. However, Tiger Global is not alone in this cautious stance. Coatue Management, another major player and co-lead investor in OpenSea, recently marked down its investment in the NFT marketplace by 90%. This reduction brought OpenSea’s valuation down to $1.4 billion, a significant decrease from its previous valuation. These markdowns by Tiger Global and Coatue Management signal a broader trend of reevaluation within the NFT market. Investors are becoming more circumspect, primarily due to fluctuating market values. Consequently, this shift could lead to more conservative investment strategies in the NFT and broader crypto sectors. Besides these adjustments, these investment giants’ moves underscore the NFT space’s evolving nature. Hence, as the market matures, further recalibrations in investments are likely. These developments may pave the way for more stable and sustainable growth in the crypto and NFT sectors in the long run.",

Rarible’s stance on creator rights led to a 637% trading volume surge within 24 hours. The partnership with Arbitrum, LayerZero, and WalletConnect strengthens RARI Chain’s commitment to ensuring fair compensation. The RARI Foundation recently unveiled an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain named RARI Chain. This chain uniquely embeds royalties into its nodes. Consequently, it offers an NFT infrastructure solution built on Arbitrum. Moreover, this innovation ensures that creators receive the royalties due to them, solidifying their success in the digital realm. Significantly, the introduction of the RARI Chain follows Rarible’s impressive trading volume surge. This uptick occurred after Rarible’s firm stance on maintaining creator royalties in August. They excluded marketplaces like OpenSea and Blur.io from their data aggregation for not supporting these royalties. This move reflects Rarible’s dedication to creator rights and has led to a 637% increase in trading volume within 24 hours, as reported by DappRadar. 1/ Following @rarible\u0027s decision to maintain creator royalties, and remove both @opensea and @blur_io from their aggregation data, Rarible\u0027s trading volume is up 637% in the past 24h.

Alex Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, emphasizes the need for a “creator-centric ecosystem.” He asserts that embedding royalties at the node level isn’t just a promise but a guarantee of creator earnings. This approach ensures a sustainable economy for digital creators. Additionally, the RARI Foundation’s partnership with key players like Arbitrum, LayerZero, and WalletConnect substantially supports the new chain. From the Arbitrum Foundation, Nina Rong highlights the importance of fair compensation for creators. She points out that enforcing royalties at the node level advances this goal. Imagine a lighting-fast chain where royalties are always guaranteed, with low and predictable costs, and Ethereum-grade security.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK New research studies offer fresh insights into the NFT market, emphasizing the roles of personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and optimism. Guneet Kaur Nagpal and Luc Renneboog’s study on CryptoPunks reveals Ethereum investors’ tendencies towards higher-cost activities and gains. The research indicates that Ethereum’s market performance influences asset sale decisions more than NFT prices. In a fascinating twist in understanding the nonfungible token (NFT) market, new research studies have revealed that personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and consumer optimism play crucial roles in market dynamics. This insight emerges from a trio of studies conducted by academicians from several prestigious institutions, offering a fresh perspective on the factors influencing the NFT landscape. At the forefront of these studies, researchers Guneet Kaur Nagpal from Western University and Luc Renneboog from Tilburg University explored the market dynamics of CryptoPunks, a leading NFT asset collection. Their study, “On Nonfungible Tokens, Blockchain Hypes, and the Creation of Scarcity,” highlighted that Ethereum (ETH) investors were more inclined to engage in higher-cost market activities and experienced significant gains. Interestingly, the study noted that ETH’s market performance did not directly influence NFT prices but impacted decisions on asset sales. Meanwhile, Chuyi Sun of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill delved into how personal experiences shape market behavior in the NFT domain. In the study “Personal Experience Effects across Markets: Evidence from NFT and Cryptocurrency Investing,” Sun analyzed data from approximately one million wallets. The findings revealed that investors receiving more valuable NFTs in initial offerings were likelier to engage in subsequent NFT purchases and gravitate towards speculative cryptocurrencies. Contrastingly, a study from the Rennes School of Business, “The Impact of Experience, Overconfidence and Optimism on Future Cryptocurrency Ownership,” conducted by Akanksha Jalan and Roman Matkovskyy, brought to light an intriguing aspect of investor behavior. Contrary to expectations, negative past experiences and investor optimism positively influenced future engagements in cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This trend suggests a unique resilience among investors, attributing losses to external factors like market volatility rather than personal decision-making. These studies offer a nuanced understanding of the NFT market, moving beyond conventional economic models. They underscore the importance of personal experiences and psychological factors in driving market trends. This research paves the way for a deeper exploration of the human elements behind the burgeoning world of NFTs, suggesting that market movements are as much about individual stories and perceptions as they are about economic indicators. The recent findings challenge traditional market theories, highlighting the complex interplay of personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and optimism in shaping the future of NFTs. This new knowledge enriches our understanding of the NFT market and opens doors for more human-centric approaches to studying digital asset economies.",

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Bioniq emerges as a key player in cryptocurrency with a Bitcoin NFT marketplace The platform uses Internet Computer Protocol to reduce network congestion and fees. Bioniq offers contract auctions and a cross-chain wallet bridging Bitcoin and ICP. Bioniq has emerged as a pivotal player in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, launching an innovative Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace. This platform stands out for its strategic use of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), significantly reducing the network congestion and high fees often associated with Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions. Developed in the wake of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq is set to revolutionize the way Bitcoin-based NFTs are traded. Leveraging the ICP’s native Bitcoin integration, Bioniq has crafted a seamless marketplace featuring innovative contract auctions and a comprehensive cross-chain wallet bridging Bitcoin and ICP. Bob Bodily, CEO and co-founder of Bioniq emphasized the platform’s quick response to the immense potential of Ordinals, starting its development as early as February 2023. The platform’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Bioniq introduces an intelligent wallet, enabling users to manage their private keys through Web3Auth. This feature brings the convenience of logging in via standard Web2 Google accounts while retaining noncustodial control over wallets and assets. Furthermore, Bioniq capitalizes on the advantages of partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) integrated within the ICP’s Bitcoin network. This integration allows for smart contract capabilities directly on Bitcoin, bypassing the need for centralized cross-chain bridges. Backed by influential names like Polychain Capital, Bioniq takes a unique approach by treating Internet Computers as a Bitcoin layer-2 network. This strategy harnesses the ICP’s efficiencies in time and cost through a token-wrapping process. Users can transfer their Bitcoin and Ordinals assets into Bioniq’s wallet, opting to wrap their assets for safekeeping while generating equivalent NFTs on the ICP network. This process enables trading on the ICP network, free from the usual gas or transaction fees and immune to the Bitcoin network’s speed limitations. Bioniq’s launch addresses the market capitalization growth of BRC-20 tokens and tackles the issue of Bitcoin network congestion. The platform’s unique approach offers a more reliable and efficient trading experience, even in high Bitcoin fee environments. Looking ahead, Bioniq plans to expand its offerings, including a launchpad for new collections, a crypto borrowing feature using Ordinals assets as collateral, and a platform for collection offers targeting specific projects. This holistic approach marks a significant step forward in the crypto marketplace, bringing efficiency and innovation to the forefront.",

Mad Lads outperformed other NFTs with over $1.39 million in 24-hour sales. The digital asset space is witnessing a remarkable surge in the value and popularity of Mad Lads, a Solana-based profile picture (PFP) NFT collection. Outperforming many leading NFT projects, Mad Lads has reached new heights in its floor price and sales volume. As noted by Solana Floor data, Mad Lads’ entry price has recently experienced a significant increase. The collection’s floor price now stands at 123 SOL, equating to over $7,100. This marks a substantial rise, with the price more than tripling in November alone. On November 13, Decrypt reported the collection’s floor value at nearly $4,500 worth of SOL, highlighting a robust growth trajectory. Regarding sales, Mad Lads is making waves in the secondary markets. Over the past 24 hours, sales have exceeded $1.39 million, according to CryptoSlam data. This volume surpasses other notable NFT projects, including the Fortune Founder’s Pass from Army of Fortune and the renowned Bored Ape Yacht Club on Ethereum. The latter registered approximately $881,000 in sales, while Solana’s Tensorians followed closely with about $810,000. Several elements contribute to the increasing demand and value of Mad Lads. The Solana token has seen significant appreciation, rising from around $21 to a current value of $58, even touching $65 recently. This price increase has impacted the broader Solana NFT market, with sales topping $62 million in November, a steep rise from October’s $28 million. Mad Lads distinguishes itself with unique attributes. Developed by startup Coral, the collection integrates with the Backpack app and its executable NFTs (xNFTs) standard, providing a range of experiences around tokenized assets. Coral’s upcoming crypto exchange, licensed in Dubai and led by former FTX general counsel Can Sun, has also added to the project’s appeal. Mad Lads NFT holders were given priority access to exchange signups and received PYTH tokens during the recent Pyth Network airdrop on Solana. These factors, combined with the project’s innovative approach and exclusive holder benefits, fuel the increasing demand for Mad Lads NFTs. Mad Lads’ success is not just a triumph for the project itself but also signifies a pivotal moment in the NFT sector, especially for Solana-based projects. Its performance against Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club, a long-time leader in the NFT market, suggests a shift in investor interest toward Solana’s ecosystem. This shift could lead to increased competition and innovation within the NFT space as projects strive to offer unique benefits and experiences to their communities. As the NFT market continues to evolve, the success of collections like Mad Lads will likely inspire new developments and trends within this dynamic and ever-changing industry.",

In a recent turn of events, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community has witnessed an alarming scam attempt. A member of this prestigious NFT group, known as Crumz, narrowly escaped a well-orchestrated scheme. The scam, posing as an opportunity for an interview with Forbes, targeted Crumz through a direct message from an impersonator of Robert LaFanco, a real Forbes editor. Crumz faced several red flags during the interview, including the interviewer’s non-premium Zoom account and a request to use a separate recorder bot for screen recording.

The BAYC community and broader NFT holders are now more aware of these tactics, thanks to the sharing of this experience by Crumz and others who have encountered similar situations.

    "fullContent": "SNEAK PEEK Azuki DAO rebrands to “Bean,” marking a significant shift in strategy. The DAO drops a lawsuit against NFT collection founder Zagabond. Bean transitions to a memecoin project within Ethereum’s Blast ecosystem. In a significant shift, Azuki DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization associated with the Azuki nonfungible token (NFT) series, has announced a rebranding to “Bean.” This change comes alongside the decision to drop a previously proposed lawsuit against the NFT collection’s founder, Zagabond. The legal action concerned a contentious $39 million NFT minting event in June, initially stirring up substantial debate within the community. Moreover, the rebranding marks a strategic pivot for the DAO. Bean will transition into a memecoin project as part of its new direction, integrating into the Ethereum layer-2 Blast ecosystem. This move will enhance the project’s presence and capabilities within the digital asset space. Developers have revealed that Bean has already garnered significant support, securing $10 million in funding from notable investors. This financial backing aims to accelerate the project’s growth and development within the Blast ecosystem. The proposed Bean memecoin will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens, indicating the project’s ambitions for widespread adoption and utility. Additionally, there have been updates regarding the token distribution plan. Initially, as outlined on the DAO’s website, the plan detailed a 40% allocation of tokens to the treasury, 50% to Azuki DAO members, and 10% to Zagabond, the Azuki NFT creator. It also stated that minting would be exclusively available to Azuki NFT holders, with a 24-hour window for action, after which any unclaimed tokens would be subject to burn. However, recent clarifications indicate changes in the distribution strategy. The follow-up statement from the developers specified that “50% of the $Bean [token] was allocated to the Azuki DAO community for the airdrop of Azuki series NFTs,” a process concluded four months ago. The statement also confirmed that “40% of $Bean [token] was allocated to the Bean Treasury, and 10% of $Bean was allocated to Zagabond.” Godspeed @cz_binance pic.twitter.com/jIaCj43sx8 — ZAGABOND.ETH (@ZAGABOND) November 21, 2023 This rebranding and strategic shift signify a new chapter for the former Azuki DAO, now Bean. By dropping the lawsuit and embarking on a fresh path with a memecoin project, the organization is set to explore new horizons in the blockchain and NFT sphere. The move reflects decentralized organizations’ dynamic and evolving nature and the digital asset industry.",

The game combines narrative-driven gameplay with Ethereum-based NFTs, marking a new direction for the company in blockchain technology.

Square Enix, the renowned developer behind the Final Fantasy series, has recently unveiled its latest venture into the world of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) by announcing auction dates for its upcoming blockchain game, Symbiogenesis. Set to revolutionize the gaming and digital collectible experience, Symbiogenesis introduces a unique blend of narrative-driven gameplay and Ethereum-based NFTs. This innovative approach marks a significant stride in Square Enix’s exploration of blockchain technology following their successful introduction of Final Fantasy NFT trading cards earlier this year. 来週より、いよいよオークションが開催！ フェーズ1：11/27 12:00～11/28 11:59 フェーズ2：11/30 12:00～12/1 11:59 フェーズ3：12/2 12:00～12/3 11:59 詳しくはこちらhttps://t.co/MFprrAq47W#SYMBIOGENESIS — SYMBIOGENESIS -NFT Art＆Game Project- | SQUARE ENIX (@symbiogenesisPR) November 24, 2023 The auctions for Symbiogenesis NFTs are scheduled in three distinct phases, each offering a different array of digital collectibles. The first phase, slated for Nov 27 to 28, is an exclusive event targeting early backers, termed “stakeholders.” This phase will feature a selection of facet and mesh characters intricately designed to capture the essence of the Symbiogenesis universe. This exclusive access underscores the company’s appreciation for early investors’ support. Following this, the second auction phase, from Nov 30 to Dec 4, and the third phase, from Dec 2 to 3, will open doors to a broader audience. Eligibility for these phases was determined through an allowlist entry campaign, which Square Enix conducted from Nov 7 to 21. This campaign was an engaging blend of quizzes and a treasure hunt within a prototype of the game world, adding an interactive element to the qualification process. Top performers in the campaign, specifically the 50 highest scorers, along with 40 randomly chosen participants from the 51st to 300th rank, earned the privilege to acquire NFTs in the second phase. The remaining participants can bid in the third phase, ensuring an inclusive participation spectrum. Symbiogenesis, described as a “narrative-unlocked NFT entertainment” game, is more than a digital collectible platform. It promises an immersive story-driven experience intertwined with the ownership and trade of unique NFTs. The scheduled launch date for this ambitious project is Dec 21, a day anticipated by gaming and crypto enthusiasts alike. Square Enix’s move into blockchain gaming reflects the company’s adaptability and innovative spirit in the ever-evolving digital entertainment landscape. With a legacy of over 173 million units sold in the Final Fantasy series alone, Square Enix’s foray into NFTs with Symbiogenesis is not just an expansion of their digital offerings but a testament to their commitment to staying at the forefront of gaming technology. As the gaming world eagerly awaits the arrival of Symbiogenesis, it stands as a beacon of the exciting possibilities that blockchain technology brings to interactive storytelling and digital ownership.",

Blue Cat NFTs reached “blue chip” status despite crypto market challenges in 2021. The brand’s diversification into gaming, merchandise, and real-world integration marks its evolution into a global lifestyle brand. The iconic NFT collection Cool Cats took a significant leap into mainstream visibility, debuting as a balloon in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This move coincides with the launch of a YouTube Shorts series, “The Milk Chug.” Hence, it marks a pivotal moment for the brand, which originated from the creative mind of artist Colin ‘Clon’ Egan. It’s almost time! 💙 pic.twitter.com/s7ObSNWOQ7 — clon (@cloncast) November 23, 2023 Initially, Clon’s Cool Cats appeared as simple artwork. However, they gained substantial traction after transitioning to Instagram in 2015. The pivotal year for Cool Cats was 2021 when 9,999 Blue Cat PFPs (Profile Picture) NFTs were released. Significantly, the collection became a “blue chip” project in the NFT boom, with prices peaking at an average of $92,000. However, the road could have been smoother. The broader crypto market downturn and community discontent saw a drop in the value of these NFTs. Consequently, the Cool Cats Group sought to diversify and expand its reach. This strategy included plans to extend to multiple blockchain networks and license its IP to game studios. Moreover, this diversification strategy is already in motion. Notably, three well-established gaming publishers, nWay, iCandy, and Sync Studios, have been tapped for game development using the Cool Cats brand. All these games are currently in the works and are expected to be released between 2023 and 2024. Additionally, a limited-edition Cool Cats hoodie will be available in a unique blend of physical and digital worlds. This hoodie, featuring an NFC tag linked to an Azuki physical-backed token, illustrates the brand’s commitment to integrating its digital assets with real-world products.

Matr1x, a Singapore-based NFT gaming company, has secured an impressive $10 million in its latest funding round. Consequently, this inflow of capital marks a significant milestone for the company. Folius Ventures spearheaded this A-2 round. Moreover, SevenX, a crypto VC firm, contributed as a co-lead investor.

He highlighted the company’s potential to redefine the gaming industry. Hence, Kam believes Matr1x could navigate the crypto slowdown and achieve mass market appeal. Significantly, Matr1x is focusing on a first-person shooter game, Matr1x Fire. This game draws aesthetic inspiration from Riot Games’ Valorant. It features similar maps, weapons, and character designs. Matr1x Fire emphasizes team play, where five-person teams compete. However, unlike Valorant, it eschews special powers for a skill-based approach. This approach aligns more with CS:GO’s gameplay style. Additionally, Matr1x aims to establish an esports presence for its game, which remains under development. The studio has introduced two NFT collections and is currently in the process of developing a third collection. This upcoming collection will provide opportunities for governance participation and a stake in the creator economy, along with featuring an upgradeable Battle Pass. However, there are concerns within the gaming community. Some gamers draw parallels between Matr1x Fire and NetEase’s Hyper Front. Riot Games previously sued NetEase over Hyper Front, alleging it copied Valorant. As a result, Hyper Front was shut down. Many fear a similar fate for Matr1x Fire. The game has already garnered labels like “Valorant Mobile” in early-access footage. Despite these concerns, Matr1x is forging ahead. The company is transparent in its distinction from Valorant. It emphasizes a different gaming experience, focusing on gunplay and tactics. This distinction is crucial for Matr1x Fire to avoid legal entanglements and carve its niche. The funding and development trajectory of Matr1x signals a potentially transformative period in mobile gaming. Hence, the industry is watching closely, anticipating the impact of Matr1x’s ambitious projects.",

CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency tracking website, recently announced the acquisition of Zash, an innovative NFT data infrastructure platform, in a strategic expansion of its data services.

Users will have seamless access to fungible and nonfungible token data, enriching their insights into the crypto market.

This innovation is expected to extend beyond Profile Pictures (PFPs) and Game Finance (GameFi), leading to new global opportunities and use cases. CoinGecko’s proactive approach follows the 2020 acquisition of its main rival, CoinMarketCap, by Binance. The company had previously expressed openness to purchases, focusing on long-term rather than short-term prospects. As Ong stated in 2022, CoinGecko is preparing for the eventual resurgence of the market, drawing on its experience from previous crypto winters. This acquisition marks a significant step for CoinGecko’s mission to provide comprehensive and accessible crypto market data.

Hanwe’s wallet, hanwe.eth, initially received 22.85 million BLUR tokens valued at $7.3 million. The value of BLUR tokens surged, reaching $0.37 each, according to CoinGecko. Surprisingly, the Blur NFT marketplace has made headlines once again. Under the pseudonymous name Hanwe, one trader walked away with a staggering $8.4 million worth of airdropped BLUR tokens from Season 2. This windfall resulted from Hanwe’s active participation in various NFT-related activities, including bids, listings, and lending, throughout Season 2. Hanwe’s hanwe.eth wallet received a whopping 22.85 million BLUR tokens, a reward initially valued at around $7.3 million when claimed shortly after the conclusion of Blur’s Season 2. However, the token’s value has since surged, with Blur’s token price experiencing an 8% increase, reaching $0.37, according to CoinGecko. Interestingly, Hanwe used the Ethereum Name Service to assign a human-readable name to their wallet, underscoring the rising trend of personalized NFT ownership. Hanwe received the largest share of rewards for Season 2, making this trader’s journey an impressive success story within the NFT space. Blur, a marketplace gaining traction rapidly and even surpassed OpenSea in NFT trading volume, has announced its plans for Season 3.

Blur will allocate 50% of the season’s rewards to those who deposit BLUR tokens into the platform in a shift from previous reward structures. This change aims to encourage more participation and engagement within the Blur ecosystem. Blur’s Season 2 also saw some traders, like @ESK_NFT on Twitter, achieving remarkable results by turning a modest starting fund into substantial airdrops, exemplifying the platform’s potential for ambitious participants. I gotta hand it to @ESK_NFT — he used just 2-3 ETH to farm Season 2 and managed to turn it into an $83,100 drop. Huge W for someone who hustles like crazy.

According to the Dec. 13 announcement, while developers continue to build Immortal Game as an online chess hub and may incorporate further decentralized technologies in the future, its goal of “giving a real opportunity for people to earn an income through chess” through Immortal Game has failed. “We found that by offering large amounts of cash with no limit barrier to entry, we encouraged heavy cheating on the platform and degraded the user experience for our legitimate player base who want a fair and safe place to play chess online,” Immortal developers wrote. “The unintended consequence of offering money to players has increased the unfair practices.” Starting this week, the marketplace for Immortal Game NFTs will be discontinued, and players will no longer be able to use the native P2E Checkmake token (CMT) in-game. NFTs, however, will continue to exist on-chain. Users will no longer be awarded CMT for completing tournaments or daily rewards, although fiat currency rewards may be offered. At the time of discontinuation, Immortal Game NFTs had a lifetime trading volume of $885,600, and its CMT token has a fully diluted market capitalization of $360,075.

    "fullContent": "More than a third of survey respondents believed the blockchain gaming industry benefited most from traditional game studios adopting Web3 tech in 2023.\nNearly 40% of blockchain game developers believe that traditional gaming studios will be one of the biggest positive driving forces for the Web3 gaming sector in 2024. In its “2023 State of the Industry Report,” released on Dec. 12, the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) found that 37.8% of respondents believed Web2 studios launching new games in Web3 or applying blockchain elements to existing titles would help push the industry forward in 2024. When asked to identify the biggest positive driver in 2023, 19.8% of respondents cited traditional game studios launching nonfungible token games, while 15.2% pointed to the same studios transitioning into Web3. Overall, 35% of all respondents believed the industry benefited the most from Web2 game studios committing to adopt Web3 technology in 2023. Blockchain game developers are convinced that 2024 will be the year of adoption growth, with more than half of respondents confident that over 20% of the total $347 billion global gaming industry will leverage blockchain technology in some way within the next year. The report surveyed 526 blockchain gaming professionals between August and October 2023. Jeffrey Gwei, founder of theweb3game.com, said that Web2 gamers will also find increasing value in digital ownership of their in-game assets moving into 2024. “The fact that survey respondents have consistently ranked ‘Digital Asset Ownership’ as the top benefit of blockchain gaming for three years running shows strong consensus among the industry in terms of the future we are all building toward,” Leah Callon-Butler, director of Web3 advisory firm Emfrasis and BGA board member, told Cointelegraph.

    "fullContent": "“Never surrender!” the former U.S. president wrote.\nFormer United States President Donald Trump is launching a third nonfungible token (NFT) drop, dubbed “MugShot,” centered around the theme of his ongoing criminal indictments. According to the Dec. 12 announcement, the trading cards are purchasable via either credit card or Wrapped Ether (wETH) and are not transferrable until Dec. 31, 2024. Users must provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information to purchase the NFTs, even if they pay with crypto. In explaining the rationale behind the collection, the collection‘s website reads: Priced at $99 each, users who purchase 47 or more digital trading cards can receive “a piece of the president’s ACTUAL suit from his famous mugshot \u0026 dinner at Mar-a-Lago with the President.” This is Trump’s third NFT drop following previous successes. Melania Trump, former first lady of the United States and wife of Donald Trump, has also previously launched an NFT collection. The 45th U.S. president is currently seeking a non-consecutive second term in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Starting this year, Trump has been indicted by both state and federal authorities on allegations of business fraud and efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, totaling 91 felony charges. However, the U.S. Constitution has no clauses automatically disqualifying suspects or convicted criminals from running for federal office. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which bars convicted insurrectionists from holding public office, requires congressional action to be enforced. https://t.co/0TJzDIcOBP Watch This Video: Don\u0027t Miss Out! pic.twitter.com/vunSPlEY6Z",

    "title": "What is Midjourney, and how to use it to create AI art?",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-midjourney-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-create-ai-art",
    "fullContent": "Uncover what Midjourney is and learn the essentials of using this innovative AI tool to create stunning and unique art pieces.\nMidjourney is a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform that allows users to generate unique artwork such as characters, images and depictions through short text prompts. A generative AI platform is an artificial intelligence system that can generate new and unique content, often in images, text or other creative outputs. Unlike traditional rule-based AI systems designed for specific tasks, generative AI platforms use advanced algorithms, typically based on deep learning techniques, to autonomously produce novel and contextually relevant outputs. Midjourney AI is one such innovative generative AI platform that opens up new possibilities for creative expression and can produce outputs that go beyond what was explicitly programmed, introducing an element of unpredictability and creativity into the AI landscape. This can be applied to various artwork domains to create realistic images that do not exist in the real world. This article discusses what Midjourney AI is, how Midjourney works, effective prompts, how Midjourney is different from Dall-E 2, and the benefits of Midjourney artwork. It will also raise the lingering question: Is it ethical to use AI-generated art? There is also a step-by-step guide to using Midjourney for artists to create unique AI-generated artworks. Related: The ABCD of AI: Automation, big data, computer vision and deep learning Midjourney is a generative AI program and service by the research lab Midjourney, Inc. The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, co-founder of Leap Motion. Like OpenAI’s DALL-E and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, Midjourney creates visuals using natural language descriptions called prompts. Midjourney’s website describes itself as “an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.” It has been in open beta since July 12, 2022, and users can create high-quality artwork with Midjourney using simple text-based prompts in Discord bot commands. No specialized hardware or software is needed to use Midjourney. However, to access the service, it is necessary to have a Discord account. Midjourney operates through the sophisticated interplay of two machine learning technologies: large language models and diffusion models. When users input prompts, a large language model deciphers the meaning of the words and transforms it into a numerical vector. This vector is pivotal in guiding the diffusion process, where Midjourney uses a diffusion model to transform random noise into visually appealing art. Diffusion models involve gradually adding random noise to a training data set of images. The model becomes adept at generating entirely new images by learning to reverse this noise over time. For example, if a user inputs a text prompt such as “Bitcoin mining with bright colors and animated appearance,” Midjourney starts with a field of visual noise. Through latent diffusion, a trained AI model systematically subtracts noise, progressively unveiling an image that embodies the essence of the specified objects and themes in the original prompt. Language comprehension and diffusion modeling synergy empower Midjourney to craft captivating and diverse AI-generated artworks based on user input or prompts. Midjourney beta can only be accessed through a Discord account. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on using Midjourney for creating unique AI-generated images: Existing Discord users can visit Midjourney.com, click the “Join the Beta” button, or go directly to the Midjourney Discord. For those who do not have a Discord account, register to create a free account on Discord first and then join the Midjourney Discord server. You can access the Midjourney Discord from anywhere — web, mobile and desktop applications. When the service first launched in July 2022, anyone could use it to generate 25 images for free. However, this changed in April 2023, with Midjourney pausing the free trial program. Midjourney is no longer freely available except for some brief promotional periods. The pricing plan can be found in the below table. To start, you can go to the channel “#newbies,” followed by a number on the Midjourney Discord server. There are many such channels, and you can pick any one of them. In the newbie channel, enter “/” followed by “imagine” and the prompt for Midjourney to generate the required images. For example, /imagine prompt: “Bitcoin mining in bright colors with an animated appearance.” Another example of a /imagine prompt, “Ethereum blockchain elements in a modern tech setting,” gave the following result: On average, Midjourney takes about a minute to generate four artwork options. However, this is not fixed, and the time may increase if one wants an upscaled image or a non-square aspect ratio output. Midjourney subscription plans have fast and relaxed modes, which will change the generation speed as per the subscribed plan. In the fast mode, waiting in line behind others is unnecessary. However, even the most expensive paid plans have a monthly limit on the number of images generated in fast mode. In the relaxed mode, image requests are sent to a queue. Generation can take anywhere between one and 10 minutes to complete. Additionally, Midjourney has an expensive “Turbo” mode that can be activated with the “/turbo” command. Turbo mode generates new images four times faster but consumes twice as much time from your monthly allowance of the subscription plan. To save the generated image on Midjourney, click on the image to open it in full size, and then right-click and choose the “Save image” option. On mobile, long-tap the image and then tap the download icon in the top right corner. Midjourney allows users to view all previously created images, including the prompts used to generate them. To access previously created Midjourney images on Discord, go to the Discord Inbox “Mention” tab and download previous images. Midjourney images are in the public domain, and ownership is open-source. Midjourney describes itself as an open community that allows others to use and remix images and prompts when posted in a public setting. By default, all images on Midjourney are publically viewable and remixable. Therefore, they can be accessed and modified by anyone. This makes it questionable to sell Midjourney artwork. Dall-E 2 is a text-to-image model and the successor of Dall-E built by the OpenAI research lab that launched ChatGPT. In 2019, OpenAI received over $1 billion in funding from Microsoft and Khosla Ventures, and in January 2023, following the launch of Dall-E 2 and ChatGPT, it received an additional $10 billion in funding from Microsoft. Midjourney is self-funded and built by an independent lab, Midjourney Inc. While Dall-E 2 and Midjourney are based on natural language descriptions that generate images from prompts, usage depends on specific requirements and preferences. Some of the differences are as follows: Midjourney has enabled artists to explore various artistic styles, themes and concepts, fostering creativity and pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms. Artists can experiment with multiple parameters and techniques, resulting in versatile outputs ranging from abstract compositions to realistic representations. It is time-saving owing to the quick AI turnaround for generating images. Furthermore, integration with platforms like Discord enhances the collaborative aspects of Midjourney, allowing artists to share ideas, techniques and creations within a community of like-minded individuals. Besides artistic expression, Midjourney is beneficial for creating product images, illustrations, social media creatives, marketing collaterals, nonfungible token (NFT) art projects, architectural visualizations and more. While AI art is legal, its ethical implications are multifaceted and involve considerations related to creativity, ownership, bias and societal impact. The common contention is that although AI tools contribute to the creation, the input and guidance come from humans. Clear guidelines on attribution and ownership are essential to addressing these issues. The commercial use of AI-generated art raises questions about fair compensation and the potential for plagiarism. Artists should be aware of the ethical implications of selling AI-generated work and how it aligns with established norms in the art world. AI models are trained on data sets that may carry biases present in the data — gender, racial or cultural biases. This can inadvertently lead to biased outputs, reinforcing existing stereotypes or prejudices. Artists and developers need to be conscious of these biases and work to mitigate them. The computational resources required to train and run advanced AI models like Midjourney and Dall-E 2 raise environmental concerns. The ethical discourse should consider the carbon footprint associated with large-scale AI operations.",

Related: Enjin migrates over 200M NFTs from Ethereum to its blockchain The NFT marketplace saw a slight shift as two emerging players took a chunk out of the NFT market, which Ethereum previously dominated. This week, NFTs in the Solana and Bitcoin networks are making strides, with Bitcoin outpacing Ethereum on certain days and Solana catching up in the third position. On Dec. 12, the Bitcoin network surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour sales volume, according to the NFT sales tracker CryptoSlam. NFT sales in Bitcoin went over $24 million, fueled by various Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs raking in millions. The network also beat Ethereum in metrics like the 30-day sales volume, with Bitcoin getting over $463 million in sales vs. Ethereum’s $373 million. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network clocked over $16 million in daily sales as NFT collections like Matr1x Kuku and Pudgy Penguins continue attracting buyers. Furthermore, data shows that the Solana network came in third, with over $6 million in 24-hour sales volume. Solana’s volume is mainly driven by the Tensorians NFT collection, the DeGods NFT project and Gaimin Gladiators. While Bitcoin is making recent gains in the NFT market, the network is still far from beating all-time sales in the Ethereum network, which stands at over $41 billion. Currently, the Bitcoin network has bagged $1 billion in all-time sales and sits at the number six rank.

    "fullContent": "Wylie Aronow said he’s been seeing many tweets this week asking when he’s planning to return to the helm at Yuga Labs.\nNonfungible token (NFT) entrepreneur Wylie Aronow has confirmed he isn’t ready to return to Yuga Labs, the NFT firm he co-founded, despite making “steady progress” with his health. “I’m not ready to come back to even part-time work. I have to ensure I’m around for a long time, for those who need me,” Aronow said on Dec. 11 in addressing rumors of a potential return. Aronow explained that some days, he’s ready to throw himself into the “deep end,” while on other days, he feels he needs to be “wheel-chaired” to an emergency room. Hey so I’ve seen a bunch of tweets this week asking / hoping I’ll come back to a leadership role at Yuga. I get where that sentiment is coming from. Couple of things on that: There’s days where I want to throw myself into the deep end, and there’s days, like yesterday, where I… Aronow, also known as Gordon Goner, took leave of absence in late January following a congestive heart failure diagnosis. In the same announcement, Wylie rejected rumors that Yuga Labs used neo-Nazi and racist imagery, referring to them as “lies.” At the time, he said he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser at Yuga Labs. Despite taking a back step, Aronow said he’s had the chance to overlook the operations of Yuga Labs — the team is behind NFT projects Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks — and suggest changes where necessary. “I identified the key issues that have been holding us back, and as of the last board meeting, which was two days ago, I feel like I’ve addressed those issues under no uncertain terms,” he explained. That said, Aronow is backing the current leadership in what could be a make-or-break year for the firm in 2024: Aronow previously explained that he was reluctant to take a step back, but his condition had deteriorated so rapidly that he had no other option but to deprioritize his work. “I pushed myself way past my limits. I worked 12 hours a day, nearly every day. I should have taken the advice from everyone around me and sought balance.” Related: BAYC creator Yuga Labs completes restructuring to focus on metaverse About a month before Aronow’s leave of absence, the firm announced Daniel Alegre — former president and chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard — as its new CEO.

The market currently accounts for an estimated $154 billion in spending. The report analyzed global sales data for blockchain game products from 2017 to 2021. It found that sales were increasing by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8%, implying that by 2030, the market will have reached $600 billion. This equates to an absolute growth rate over the six-year period of nearly 299%. Fortune’s researchers divided the world into five regions: North America, South America, Middle East/Africa, Europe and Asia Pacific. North America posted the largest share of blockchain game item purchases for any region in 2022, accounting for over $30 billion, or approximately 24% of the total. The researchers stated that they expect this North American dominance to continue. When it comes to the category of games offered, the report stated that it expects role-playing games to have the highest growth rate when compared to other categories. These games have “special characters, themes, additional weapons, accessories, and other features” that make them especially suited to implementing blockchain features. Role-playing games represented over 33% of the market in 2022, it stated. Web-based blockchain games currently represent the largest segment of blockchain games, which the researchers expect to continue dominating. However, they also stated that Android-based games are becoming more prevalent.

    "fullContent": "Atlas Development Services executive Oscar Franklin Tan told Cointelegraph that to avoid the gas fees for transferring 200 million NFTs, it took a different approach in the migration.\nNonfungible token (NFT) platform Enjin recently migrated over 200 million NFTs from Ethereum and a sidechain to its own Enjin Blockchain. In an announcement received by Cointelegraph, Enjin noted that over 118 million NFTs hosted on Ethereum, along with over 101 million NFTs hosted in an Ethereum sidechain called JumpNet, have been transferred to its mainnet called the Enjin Blockchain. In June, the NFT platform announced the creation of its own blockchain. Enjin said the new network embedded NFT-focused features such as NFT transfers and royalty enforcement into the blockchain’s foundational code. With the transition, users will experience several changes, such as the built-in royalties and a new feature called “Fuel Tanks,” which lets developers subsidize gas fees for users. According to the announcement, the platform will use this feature to give users free transactions across its ecosystem for three months. On Dec. 6, executives working in the gaming industry weighed in on the future of blockchain gaming and highlighted several catalysts to Web3 adoption in gaming. Bartosz Skwarczek, the founder and CEO of G2A Capital Group, told Cointelegraph that improvements in accessibility and user interfaces would attract a broader gamer audience to Web3. Similarly, Rene Stefancic, the chief operating officer of Atlas Development Services, a core contributor to the Enjin Blockchain, said that the push to a different blockchain could potentially allow Web3 to “tap into the three billion-strong global gamer market.” Related: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of Atlas, told Cointelegraph that to avoid an “incredible amount of gas fees” for transferring over 200 million NFTs, the platform has taken a different approach with their migration. Tan said: Tan explained that this process lets users claim without paying for gas. However, one potential drawback is that instead of the NFTs being burned in Ethereum, they will still exist on the previous networks. “Creators have to ask holders not to trade them and consider the Enjin Blockchain versions the official versions,” Tan added.

    "fullContent": "Users who deposit digital assets to exchanges in South Korea will be eligible to receive interest on their deposits.\nSouth Korean regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), published a notice highlighting that by July 2024, investors in digital assets must receive interest when depositing their funds into an exchange. However, the guidance clarified that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are excluded from the law. On Dec. 10, local media outlets reported the FSC plans to release the legislative guidance. Despite the exclusion of NFTs, the regulator also noted that there can be exceptions. According to the report, even if the tokens are categorized as NFTs but function as a payment method and are issued in large quantities, they may be included in the virtual asset classification. In this case, the assets may be eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. Apart from classifying virtual assets, the South Korean regulator also determined the method for handling user deposits for virtual asset operators. The notice highlighted that exchanges must separate user deposits and their own assets and entrust these to a bank. In addition, 80% of the coins must be kept in a cold wallet. Related: NFT trading volume nears $1B as markets turn bullish: Report The guidance will also include requirements for preparing for hacks or other computer incidents. The regulator said that virtual asset service providers should sign up for insurance or accumulate reserves. Meanwhile, the law also prohibits the blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it’s absolutely necessary and when requested by courts and financial regulators. South Korea has been solidifying its regulations on the crypto space. Earlier in December, financial regulators in the country asked users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges offering services within the region. The Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea were in charge of the initiative.

    "fullContent": "The average value of NFT transactions climbed from $126 to $270, showing an increase of 114% in November.\nAs crypto markets turn bullish, nonfungible token (NFT) trading has started to join the wave, with volume nearing $1 billion in November, according to data published by the decentralized app tracking platform DappRadar. The report highlighted that the NFT industry maintained upward momentum for the second month in a row. Trading volume surged by 125% in November, suggesting a shift in user behavior compared to earlier downturns in NFT trading. On Nov. 6, analytics firm Nansen reported that NFT sales volumes showed continued weekly increases in October. NFT sales consistently went up, from $56 million in the week ending on Oct. 9 to $129 million in the week ending on Nov. 5. Executives working in Web3 believe that this trend may continue further in the coming months. On Nov. 14, SuperRare co-founder Jonathan Perkins told Cointelegraph that the worst of the bear market is “behind us” and things are starting to turn around. Apart from the uptick in trading volume, the average value of NFT transactions also increased by 114%, climbing from $126 to $270 in November.

According to DappRadar, on-chain gaming UAWs saw a rise of 14% and had a 34% market dominance in the decentralized applications industry. DappRadar noted that the sector “continues to be a fundamental pillar” in the decentralized ecosystem. Despite a seemingly bearish mood all year, blockchain gaming projects managed to secure $2.3 billion in investments from the start of 2023 up to October. An earlier DappRadar report showed that in the third quarter of 2023 alone, blockchain gaming secured $600 million in investments despite crypto market prices being lower compared to its peaks.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/armenian-cultural-heritage-sites-get-tokenized-on-solana-blockchain",
    "fullContent": "The initiative “Realm of Historia” is on a mission to tokenize historical sites in Armenia and around the world using the blockchain to preserve cultural heritage for future generations.\nThe Realm of Historia project recently announced its intentions to make strides in preserving Armenian cultural heritage through leveraging the use of blockchain technology and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In a departure from conventional methods, this initiative seeks to digitize historical artifacts and physical historical sites, starting with the Realm of Historia: Carahunge X digital asset collection. Cointelegraph spoke with the two creators of Realm of Historia, Ivan Grantovsky and Ivan Krylov, about how emerging technologies can preserve culture and connect new generations with history. At the core of Realm of Historia’s effort is the Solana blockchain, which the two developers said was chosen for efficiency and transparency purposes. Krylov said part of the inspiration for creating a platform is the lack of engaging platforms that digitally present cultural heritage and are transparent with how to participate philanthropically. The Realm of Historia: Carahunge X collection aims to digitize the tangible essence of the Carahunge site, known as the Stonehenge of Armenia, which dates back to 5487 BC. All the NFTs in the collection combine art and digital versions of the stones from the physical site. In addition to digitizing pieces of cultural heritage, the project also aims to support local artists in Armenia and has collaborations with entities like the Yerevan Biennial Art Foundation (YBAF), A1 Art Space and Latitude Art Space. 1 | Born in Yerevan, Armenia, amidst a family of artists, Lilit Eghiazaryan\u0027s journey in the realm of art was predestined pic.twitter.com/LEwznJfVB5 The founders of Realm of Historia said they see this project playing a pivotal role in bridging cultural divides, empowering local artists and showcasing Armenia’s cultural richness through emerging tech. Related: How generative AI allows one architect to reimagine ancient cities The project has a physical-digital aspect in the form of a QR code accompanying each NFT that can be scanned and redeemed in local cafes, museums and other sites in Armenia that have partnered with the project, they said. This initiative aligns with a broader global trend recognizing blockchain’s potential in cultural heritage preservation. The decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain ensures a reliable record of historical assets, guaranteeing their unaltered accessibility for future generations. In a similar project in Ukraine, a local art museum used blockchain digitization and NFTs to document and preserve art and cultural heritage during wartime. More recently, The Sandbox Web3 metaverse platform collaborated with the British Museum to bring art and history to the metaverse in physical-digital experiences. The team behind Realm of Historia also plans to build “The Atrium” or a “virtual museum hall” where users can enter a 3D lobby dedicated to cultural heritage and the sites represented by the project. In 2022, the island of Tuvalu, which is rapidly sinking into the sea, announced similar plans to build a digital version of itself to preserve its history as it faces erasure due to climate change. The Realm of Historia founders said their goal is to eventually go beyond Armenia and build collections “everywhere we can all over the world.” They said they’re in talks about potential preservation projects in Malta, Italy, Cambodia and Georgia.
