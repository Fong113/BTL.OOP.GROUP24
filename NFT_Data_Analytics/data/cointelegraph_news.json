    "fullContent": "Rarible has cemented its commitment to NFT royalty enforcement by launching a testnet for an EVM-compatible chain with embedded royalties at the node level.\nThe RARI Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Rarible ecosystem, officially released a testnet for an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain called “RARI Chain,” with royalties embedded into its nodes. In an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, the RARI Foundation said that RARI Chain will be a nonfungible token (NFT) infrastructure solution built on Arbitrum. With royalties embedded at the node level, the RARI Foundation said that creators will have the tools they need to be successful in their endeavors. The move follows a recent uptick in Rarible’s trading volume after demonstrating its NFT marketplace’s commitment to royalties. On Aug. 23, the 24-hour trading volume on Rarible jumped nearly 585% after it removed marketplaces that don’t support royalties and royalty enforcement from its aggregation data. 1/ Following @rarible\u0027s decision to maintain creator royalties, and remove both @opensea and @blur_io from their aggregation data, Rarible\u0027s trading volume is up 637% in the past 24h. Do you think Rarible is right? View @rarible on DappRadar https://t.co/9hh0AQa7Nj pic.twitter.com/cg1dPChYar Jana Bertram, head of strategy at the RARI Foundation, said in a statement that creators are the driving force behind the expansion of NFTs. Bertram explained: Meanwhile, Rarible co-founder Alex Salnikov said they believe Web3 should be a “creator-centric ecosystem” that allows artists to thrive. Salnikov claims that RARI Chain is a move to protect creators’ earnings. “By enforcing royalties at the node level, we are ensuring that creator royalties are more than just a promise — they are a guarantee,” he said.

Nina Rong, head of ecosystem development at the Arbitrum Foundation, also commented on the new development, saying that creators deserve to be “fairly rewarded” for their efforts. The executive highlighted that royalty enforcement at the node level is a significant step in achieving this.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-sales-web3-pricing-cryptocurrency-luck-scarcity-optimism",
    "fullContent": "Several new research studies indicate that personal experiences may be the NFT market’s primary mover.\nA trio of studies published in November may shine some light on the social and psychological factors that motivate movement in the nonfungible token (NFT) market. Across three independent studies, researchers from Western University in Canada, Tilburg University in the Netherlands, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the United States, and Rennes School of Business in France found that personal experiences and luck, along with asset scarcity and consumer optimism, were catalysts for the majority of market movement in the NFT space. In a study conducted by Guneet Kaur Nagpal of Western University and Luc Renneboog of Tilburg University titled “On Non-fungible Tokens, Blockchain Hypes, and the Creation of Scarcity,” the researchers analyzed the market dynamics of CryptoPunks, a popular collection of NFT assets. “CryptoPunks,” write the researchers, “are among the most valued Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), with remarkable sales such as CP #5822 fetching USD 23.7 million in February 2022, and CP #7523 obtaining USD 11.8 million in December 2021.” The primary findings, according to the paper, include the assessment that buyers who were already invested in Ether (ETH), the native coin of Ethereum — the blockchain on which CryptoPunks assets reside — were more likely to engage in the market at higher costs and also saw higher gains. The researchers also noted that ETH gains and losses didn’t necessarily affect the price of NFTs but did influence the decision to sell or resell assets. Furthermore, the study states: In a separate study titled “Personal Experience Effects across Markets: Evidence from NFT and Cryptocurrency Investing,” researcher Chuyi Sun of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill examined transaction-level data from “about one million” wallets to study how “personal experiences” contributed to bubbles in the NFT market. ”I find that NFT investors who randomly receive more valuable NFTs in the primary market are more likely to participate in subsequent primary market sales,” wrote Sun, adding that investors who randomly receive more valuable NFTs are more likely to eventually purchase “more lottery-like” cryptocurrencies. A third study, titled “The Impact of Experience, Overconfidence and Optimism on Future Cryptocurrency Ownership” and conducted by Akanksha Jalan and Roman Matkovskyy of Rennes School of Business, takes a deep dive into the dynamics surrounding investor optimism and their knock-on effect for the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Related: The ‘WAGMI’ mentality is undermining crypto In this study, the researchers found, counter-intuitively, that negative past experiences and investor optimism both positively affect the odds of future cryptocurrency and NFT ownership. “The fact that individual crypto investors with negative experiences with cryptocurrencies continue to show interest in the asset class could reflect some form of self-serving bias,” wrote the authors, before adding, “with these investors likely attributing their losses to factors beyond their control (like market volatility) rather than poor decision-making on their part.”",

    "title": "Bitcoin NFT marketplace Bioniq eyes lofty goal of alleviating network congestion",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-nft-marketplace-bioniq-congestion",
    "fullContent": "Bioniq operates on the Internet Computer Protocol, tapping into native Bitcoin integration to ease the network congestion and high fees associated with Ordinals inscriptions.\nA new Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace aims to reduce network fees associated with the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions by tapping into the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Developed off the back of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq operates on the ICP and taps into its native Bitcoin integration to power the trade of Bitcoin-based Ordinals inscriptions. Speaking to Cointelegraph on the eve of the platform’s launch, Bioniq CEO and co-founder Bob Bodily said the project has been in development since February 2023. The team has built a marketplace featuring Ordinals smart contracts auctions on the ICP, a complete cross-chain wallet between Bitcoin and the ICP, as well as an inscription tool. The Bioniq team highlighted the growth in the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens since their inception in Jan. 2023. The market cap now exceeds $3 billion, with over 42.6 million Ordinals minted to date. This has directly affected Bitcoin network congestion, leading to a spike in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees last seen since 2021. Bioniq’s platform features a smart wallet for users to manage private keys using Web3Auth. This allows users to log into the platform using conventional Web2 Google accounts while maintaining noncustodial control of their wallets and assets. The platform also uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) through the ICP’s Bitcoin network integration. This unlocks smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin, removing the need for users to use centralized cross-chain bridges. Building on ICP also allows Bioniq to claim transaction finality times below two seconds, as well as zero gas or network fees. Its architecture provides optimized storage costs, averaging around $5 per gigabyte of data stored annually. Bodily added that Toniq, the studio behind Bioniq, has been developing on the ICP since May 2021 and has extensive experience building smart contract wallets, marketplaces, NFT launchpads and collateralized NFT lending protocols: Bodily explains that ICP operates a Bitcoin light node running fully on-chain, which facilitates reading the Bitcoin blockchain via native smart contract calls. The ICP also has a threshold digital signature algorithm, known as an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The implementation allows ICP smart contracts to sign layer-1 Bitcoin transactions and broadcast them to the mempool. “These protocol primitives also enabled us to build an Ordinals wrapper entirely at the application layer; we didn’t have to touch the consensus layer of the protocol at all. So it is very fast to build Bitcoin tech on ICP right now,” Bodily added. Cointelegraph also inquired whether Bioniq’s wrapping process could be a potential barrier to entry for users. Bodily admits that while the process is largely automated by the Bioniq wallet and only requires BTC, there are two considerations that are pertinent for more discerning users. “Wrapping requires a Bitcoin transaction. This means you have to pay in order to wrap. This is a significant barrier. One way we are addressing the problem is by integrating open Nostr PSBT listings into Bioniq,” Bodily explained. This integration means that PSBT listings stored on Nostr through decentralized Ordinals marketplaces OpenOrdex or Deezy Place will be accessible on Bioniq. He added that it removes the need to wrap Bitcoin transactions, as users could list directly on Bioniq using open PSBTs. Perhaps more importantly, Bodily explained that the wrapping process requires “trust assumptions” on both protocols: Bodily adds that Bioniq is focusing on developing user experience ahead of inheriting Bitcoin’s security, which is ensured by the finality of layer-1 transactions. However, he envisions a “nice decentralization path” for applications like Bioniq. This would involve the evolution from being built on a sidechain with additional trust assumptions to “becoming a Bitcoin sovereign rollup on ICP that is trust minimized.” The final step would see Bioniq becoming a Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) on the ICP with no additional trust assumptions, inheriting the full security and decentralization of Bitcoin. A number of NFT marketplaces already offer Bitcoin Ordinals auctions and trading, which begs the question of what an exclusively Ordinals platform will bring to the ecosystem. Bodily believes that existing offerings that featured “softer pivots” to Ordinals on their platforms were hamstrung by confusing user experiences. Developing a “dedicated Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, built for Bitcoin users natively” hinges on developing a native cross-chain, BTC-ICP wallet. In addition, Bitcoin’s unchallenged position as the preeminent and largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains another drawcard for the continued interest in Bitcoin NFTs into the future. Bioniq joins the likes of Ordinals Market as a Bitcoin-only Ordinals marketplace. Gamma is another Ordinals marketplace that directly mints to Bitcoin’s layer-1 chain. Ordswap was an early Ordinals marketplace that has since closed down after losing control of its website to hackers. Meanwhile, multichain platforms like Magic Eden prominently list Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs.",

    "fullContent": "The soccer star’s Binance-tied NFTs allegedly promoted investments in unregistered securities on the crypto exchange.\nPro-soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has been hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit from plaintiffs claiming they suffered losses from his promotion of the now-legally embroiled crypto exchange Binance. A Nov. 27 filing to a United States district court in Florida claimed Ronaldo “promoted, assisted in, and/or actively participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in coordination with Binance.” Binance entered a multiyear partnership with Ronaldo in mid-2022 to promote a series of his own nonfungible tokens (NFTs), with at least three of the soccer star’s collections tied to Binance. The complaint claims users who signed up for Ronaldo’s NFTs were more likely to use Binance for other purposes, such as investing in what they claim are unregistered securities, including Binance’s BNB (BNB) and its crypto yield programs. Ronaldo was a key part of Binance’s growing popularity due to his influence and reach, with 850 million followers across social media, says the complaint. They allege his NFT sales were “incredibly successful” at promoting the exchange, with a 500% increase in searches for Binance the week following the initial sale. Cooking something up with @binance https://t.co/FMAP5GAdxE The suit alleges Ronaldo knew or should have known “about Binance selling unregistered crypto securities,” as he has “investment experience and vast resources to obtain outside advisers.” Related: Why Binance’s US plea deal could be positive for crypto adoption The suit cited U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance warning celebrities of the need to disclose payments received for promoting cryptocurrencies, which the complaint claims Ronaldo didn’t do. The class-action lawsuit plaintiffs are Michael Sizemore, Mikey Vongdara and Gordon Lewis, who seek damages and funds to cover legal fees. Meanwhile, Binance and its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao are facing their own legal woes, pleading guilty and paying a $4.3 billion settlement to the U.S. government for violations of Anti-Money Laundering laws and running an unregistered money-transmitting business. Zhao has stepped down as CEO and faces up to 18 months in prison. Binance has agreed to up to five years of compliance monitoring by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. The SEC has also sued Binance, claiming — among other charges — that it sold unregistered securities and is reportedly investigating if Binance misappropriated customer funds.

    "fullContent": "Greed, irrationality and anxiety have contributed to chaos in the crypto market. Investors should work on self-improvement if they want the industry to succeed.\nIn 2021, it seemed as if 10 new Disneys — and the next 20 Picassos — were emerging from blockchain and various nonfungible token (NFT) collections. Exorbitant NFT values that year signaled strong belief in many projects. But two years later, those “next Disneys” have delivered little. The situation has created significant market frustration and disillusionment among investors and enthusiasts alike. Project failures are often attributed to founders. Yet, the greed, anxiety and irrationality prevalent among Web3 participants have also played a substantial role in the ecosystem. Related: 3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market We’re in a complex environment where even the most skilled and visionary founders find it challenging to navigate the market dynamics. This often leaves a trail of unfinished projects and unfulfilled promises, further eroding trust in the sector. Imagine a party with tickets priced at $100. Someone eager to attend with friends misses the initial sale. Turning to the secondary market, they pay $500 for a ticket. The likelihood of disappointment is high since the event intended to offer a $100 experience. With a $500 ticket, expectations are inevitably higher, which often means the experience doesn’t match reality. In the crypto market, this greed-induced frustration is apparent. You can pay 20 Ether (ETH) for an NFT that initially sold for 0.5 ETH, but it is essential to align your expectations with the 0.5 ETH value. (That’s especially true considering how Web3 royalties have declined, a situation that has also prevented founders from obtaining the benefits of high-value secondary sales.) Placing your mental emphasis on the first price you see for an item — instead of taking the full context into account — is known as anchoring bias, where initial information heavily influences later decisions and perceptions. That means buyers view the high price of NFTs they purchase as an “anchor” for their expectations regarding utility, leading to a cycle of disappointment. Developing a quality product takes time. But the market often expects unrealistically quick progress. That expectation puts immense pressure on builders and founders, who find themselves in a cycle of continual announcements to satisfy the community’s desire for constant stimulation and progress. In the last cycle, big gaming projects offered one example of this phenomenon. Some individuals believed that ambitious AAA games — built on Unreal Engine 5 — would be delivered in mere months, even though they typically require three to five years of development. They dumped their tokens when they realized it would take longer, as one year feels like 10 when you’re addicted to volatility. In some cases, opening the process of building to the public is a blessing that Web3 has made possible. However, it can also create a toxic climate that negatively affects the mindset and well-being of project founders. Studies have indicated that roughly 75% of venture-backed startups fail. Like startups, NFT collections operate in risky, experimental environments. Yet, the market often overlooks the risk, instead expecting indefinite success and growth. This is highly driven by confirmation bias, a psychological phenomenon that involves putting an emphasis on information that aligns with a person’s existing beliefs and preferences while ignoring contradictory evidence. During the previous bull run, this was epitomized by “WAGMI,” an acronym for “We’re all going to make it.” But in a market driven by buying and selling, some participants must lose in order for others to win. That, unfortunately, means there is no WAGMI — especially in an environment with low financial literacy and a lot of anxiety. This combination can be particularly dangerous as it leads to decisions driven more by emotion than rational analysis. Related: History tells us we’re in for a strong bull market with a hard landing On the bright side, the ecosystem has evolved a lot since 2021. The good projects that managed to adapt to market changes and the market context are becoming more evident, and there has also been significant human maturation. Many founders became “CEOs” overnight, which is analogous to changing a car’s tires while it’s moving at 100 miles per hour — 24 hours per day, seven days per week. After almost three years and some pivots, many of these CEOs and teams are much more mature, prepared and focused on delivering something of value. And while success depends largely on them, it also depends on the maturity of the Web3 community. Good leaders will not be enough to fix the game if it’s broken by excessive greed, anxiety and irrationality. Investors should consider this — and try to improve, financially and personally — as we enter the next bull run.

On Nov. 27, nonfungible token (NFT) collector “Crumz” detailed his run-in with a scammer posing as a Forbes journalist. He reported that someone pretending to be Robert LaFanco — a real Forbes editor — contacted him by direct message from an impersonator account with the offer of an interview for a new article about BAYC. SCAM ALERT!! I just spent the last 2hours on Zoom with \u0027@Forbes\u0027 it was pretty sophisticated and well thought out because I\u0027m usually on high alert but luckily I wasn\u0027t caught. Here\u0027s what they did. 1/8 During the interview, the scammer prompted Crumz to click a button to allow access to record the interview. Crumz said he complied with the so-called journalists despite certain red flags, including their use of a non-premium Zoom account and wanting to use a separate recorder bot to record his screen. “I had to press a button to allow access to record,” he said before adding, “I didn’t think much of it first, but at the end, he asks me to say something that resembles my ape, and he suggests a banana.” Crumz said he later realized this was a distraction attempt to take him away from his computer during which the attacker would take control of his computer to steal his assets. Crumz said instead of getting the banana, he waited by his computer and sure enough, the scammers started to control his screen. 8/8 Hopefully I\u0027m safe now. Don\u0027t think they can still control my computer when I turn it back on. Please be safe out there, it could\u0027ve been a dreadful day today Crypto casino Rollbit partner borowik.eth echoed the warning to his 140,000 X (formerly Twitter) followers on Nov. 27. He also fingered a spurious account named Robert LaFranco, whose profile claims he is a Forbes assistant managing editor. “During this interview, he attempts to trick you to gain access to your PC and steal your expensive NFTs,” he warned. ⚠️ WATCH OUT ⚠️ A fake Forbes journalist is reaching out to BAYC holders for a fake interview During this interview he attempts to trick you to gain access to your PC and steal your expensive NFTs It’s very unlikely Forbes would reach out pic.twitter.com/ViYrT0mk1l Meanwhile, BAYC community member Laura Rod also reported being contacted by the bogus Forbes editor.

In October, a Friend.tech user reported being duped by a fake Bloomberg journalist, who lured them into clicking a link for a “consent form,” which instead resulted in a drained Friend.tech account. Meanwhile, several industry observers have noted that scammers on X often have a BAYC profile picture, which is something to look out for.

    "fullContent": "The DAO previously proposed a lawsuit against Azuki creator Zagabond over a dilutive $39 million NFT minting that took place in June.\nUpdate - November 25 11:45 AM UTC: This article was updated after receiving a clarification statement from an Azuki DAO spokesperson regarding its token distribution plan. Azuki DAO, an unofficial community decentralized autonomous organization surrounding the namesake nonfungible token collection, has announced its rebranding to “Bean\" as it drops a proposed lawsuit against the NFT collection’s founder, Zagabond, over a $39 million minting affair. In a statement sent to Cointelegraph, Azuki developers said the DAO will rebrand into a memecoin project and become part of the Ethereum layer-2 Blast ecosystem. Developers also claims that Bean has also secured $10 million from “prominent investors” for its development and acceleration within the Blast ecosystem. The proposed Bean memecoin will have a total supply of 1 billion. In a follow-up statement sent to Cointelegraph, Azuki DAO developers said that the current token supply plan displayed on its website is \"out of date.\" The plan previously states that 40% percent of tokens are allocated to its treasury, 50% to Azuki DAO members, and 10% to Azuki NFT creator Zagabond. The plan also previously stated that minting would only available to Azuki NFT holders, who must do so within 24 hours of the token’s launch or face “token burn.” The follow-up statement explains that \"50% of the $Bean [token] was allocated to the Azuki DAO community for the airdrop of Azuki series NFTs,\" which concluded four months ago. \"The remaining tokens are still in the address,\" they said. \"40% of $Bean [token] was allocated to the Bean Treasury, and 10% of $Bean was allocated to Zagabond, which is currently still in the address.\" The Azuki NFT collection represents 10,000 anime-themed profile pictures (PFPs). In June, a second series of 10,000 PFPs in the Azuki collection, dubbed “Elementals,” was released by Zagabond. Immediately after release, however, users noticed the close resemblance of Elemental PFPs to Azuki PFPs, thereby leading to the dilution of the latter through an increase in supply. The price of Azuki NFTs reportedly fell 44% in the immediate aftermath of Elementals’ release. The move also triggered a community lawsuit proposal launched by Azuki DAO against creator Zagabond. “Detailed information on financing and a roadmap for future developments will be disclosed shortly,” developers wrote.

    "fullContent": "The company said Symbiogenesis NFTs will be auctioned off in three separate phases.\nFinal Fantasy game developer Square Enix has announced auction dates for its upcoming Symbiogenesis nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In a Nov. 24 social media post, the team said it would sell the NFTs in three batches. The first batch will be auctioned from Nov. 27 to 28, the second from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4, and the third from Dec. 2 to 3. Symbiogenesis is Square Enix’s upcoming blockchain game that features Ethereum-based NFTs. Starting next week, it\u0027s finally time for the start of the auction! Phase 1: 11/27 12:00 - 11/28 11:59 (JST) Phase 2: 11/30 12:00 - 12/1 11:59 (JST) Phase 3: 12/2 12:00 - 12/3 11:59 (JST) More details herehttps://t.co/MFprrApwio#SYMBIOGENESIS According to the game’s documents, the first phase will include facet and mesh characters and will only allow “stakeholders” to participate. This seems to imply that only early investors will be able to participate in the Nov. 27–28 phase. The second and third phases will be available to participants in an “allowlist entry campaign,” the documents state. The game’s team ran the allowlist entry campaign from Nov. 7 to 21. Collectors were asked to participate in a series of quizzes, as well as a “treasure hunt” that took place within a prototype version of the Symbiogenesis game world. The participants earned NFT “relics” as a result of these activities, and they scored points toward participating in phase 2.

    "fullContent": "CoinGecko has acquired the NFT data infrastructure platform Zash as the firm remains bullish about the NFT market. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed.\nMajor cryptocurrency tracking website CoinGecko is scaling its data offering by acquiring the nonfungible token (NFT) data infrastructure platform Zash. CoinGecko plans to integrate Zash’s NFT data into its application programming interface (API) by the second quarter of 2024, the firm announced on Nov. 21, though the deal terms have not been disclosed. “API users will be able to enjoy a unified crypto data offering, where they can access fungible and nonfungible token data seamlessly and enjoy enriched crypto market insights,” CoinGecko co-founder and chief operating officer Bobby Ong told Cointelegraph. According to the exec, front-end users of CoinGecko’s web and mobile app will also be able to access the on-chain NFT data through the NFT floor price tracker next year. CoinGecko didn’t disclose the cost of the Zash acquisition to Cointelegraph. Founded in 2021, Zash operates an enterprise-grade NFT indexer and API, allowing users to track NFT data across 87 unique marketplaces — or a total of 102 marketplaces — like the major NFT exchange OpenSea. “Zash’s data also encompasses secondary sales, bundled trades, converts settlement in 12 currencies and encompass ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards,” Ong noted, adding that Zash’s coverage is “over four times more than alternatives.” Related: Crypto exchange Bullish buys 100% stake in crypto media site CoinDesk: Report CoinGecko’s latest move into the NFT market comes despite a significant decline in the NFT market, which is sometimes interpreted as a signal the NFT technology is maturing rather than a sign of distress. CoinGecko is bullish on the NFT industry despite the ongoing market decline, Ong said, stating: After Binance acquired CoinGecko’s primary competitor, CoinMarketCap, in 2020, CoinGecko was also open to acquisitions as of July 2022. However, the firm considered potential acquisitions in the long rather than the short term. “This will be our third crypto winter, and we are focused on improving CoinGecko to prepare for the eventual bull run that will come again,” CoinGecko’s Ong told Cointelegraph in 2022.

    "title": "How can NFTs help farmers — from production to distribution?",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-can-nfts-help-farmers-from-production-to-distribution",
    "fullContent": "From avocado trees to blockchain, learn what utility NFTs are and how they’re reshaping the agricultural industry.\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) have traditionally been associated with digital art, profile pictures and other digital collectibles. Capable of preserving uniqueness, these tokens are still popular, but there is another type of NFTs that goes one step further — NFTs. They offer tangible and real-world benefits to holders. Utility NFTs offer immediate value upon purchase by granting access to certain privileges or exclusive experiences. For example, they can unlock premium content, provide memberships, or allow holders to redeem rewards or items. The value of the utility NFT most often derives from the value of the real-world item or experience it represents. However, it can also have intrinsic value based on rarity and popularity. Technically, utility NFTs are no different than regular NFTs — they leverage blockchain technology to ensure uniqueness, ownership and authenticity. The only difference is that they are directly linked to specific items or experiences. They are minted on decentralized networks using smart contract standards explicitly developed for NFTs. Utility NFTs are industry-agnostic, meaning they do not specialize in a specific industry and can transform many sectors and experiences, from gaming and fashion to live concerts and real estate. While it may be surprising, agriculture can also integrate these NFTs for various use cases to bring efficiency and transparency. NFTs can revolutionize the agricultural industry by providing a more transparent, efficient, and secure way to manage the supply chain. They, like digital crop certificates, can track ownership and authenticity throughout the supply chain, from farm to consumer, and can be used to digitize and manage physical assets relating to crops, livestock, and land. This can enhance transparency, improve efficiency, and unlock new possibilities for financing, trading, and insurance in the agricultural sector. One area where NFTs can have a huge impact is supply-chain management. NFTs and their underlying blockchain technology can certify the ownership and authenticity of assets, which makes these tokens suitable for the tracking of agricultural products. The main difference between utility NFTs and current traceability methods is that NFTs can be traced back to the individual farm or crop where the product came from. As the NFT moves along the supply chain, all the important information about the product is always available and can be checked, making sure that the product meets all the standards from the farm to the store. An ecosystem can mint NFTs for every stage of the supply chain, from the farm to the store. This would enable stakeholders and end users to verify where a food product came from and how it reached the market’s shelf. Utility NFTs, in this case, can grant stakeholders ownership rights over certain food products. These rights are essential for a more equitable, transparent, and sustainable food system. They empower farmers by granting them ownership of their produce, leading to fairer profits and improved livelihoods. This transparency extends to consumers, who can make informed choices about their food. Moreover, stakeholder ownership incentivizes farmers to produce high-quality food and reduces food waste by enabling direct sales to consumers. NFTs and blockchains are all about decentralization, transparency, proof of ownership and security. These features come to address several challenges in agriculture, an industry that still uses many old-school methods to grow and distribute food and goods. This reflects on the quality, efficiency and costs of production, eventually affecting the profitability of farmers and other stakeholders. Thanks to NFTs, stakeholders can create a secure, immutable record on the blockchain, enabling access to real-time data related to the entire supply chain of agricultural products. This unmatched level of transparency helps prevent fraud, ensures food safety and improves the implementation of sustainability practices. By bringing efficiency to all supply chain stages, NFT implementation can cut costs and have a positive impact on profitability. The integration of utility NFTs into supply-chain processes and other use cases can be a win-win for both farmers and consumers. One example of how NFTs can help the agricultural sector is illustrated by Dimitra, a leading blockchain-based enterprise system for AgTech driving productive, intelligent and inclusive farming. Dimitra helps farmers reduce efforts and improve efficiency by integrating its technology stack, including blockchain, mobile, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), drones and satellites. Dimitra’s utility NFTs offer innovative solutions for the agricultural sector, enabling farmers to secure financing, establish direct consumer connections, and monetize valuable data to make smarter decisions. This approach aims to streamline financing processes, promote transparency and fair pricing, and provide farmers with additional revenue opportunities. Despite their benefits and potential, farmers and consumers should be aware of certain limitations of NFTs and blockchain technology in general. To begin with, blockchains are closed systems without access to real-world data. Therefore, connecting an on-chain NFT with a physical or digital off-chain asset requires additional effort. This can be achieved with the help of so-called oracles or other conditions embedded into the smart contract itself. Eventually, stakeholders must ensure that the tokens accurately represent the underlying products, be it crops, livestock or bonds. For example, Dimitra has developed its Land Suitability Oracle that evaluates each farm based on its potential to grow a particular crop. Moreover, Dimitra already has an application that assesses farmer performance. The combination of these tools provides a significant capability for agricultural lenders compared to the available tools. NFTs can be used independently or with other blockchain applications to improve supply-chain management at all stages. For example, Dimitra is revolutionizing farming with utility NFTs, starting with avocados. The company has recently launched an NFT series in collaboration with One Million Avocados, a Kenya-based startup. These NFTs enable individuals to sponsor avocado trees for $50, providing farmers with essential resources like seedlings and fertilizers as well as digital platform access and sensors. Dimitra is also developing a Crop Certificate program where, through a Web3 interface, investors provide a loan through a regulated crowdfunding process and get premiums repaid from the proceeds of the crop harvest.  Source: Dimitra This unique approach improves security, combating avocado theft in Africa. Unlike traditional loans, which are challenging for avocado farmers due to the crop’s long maturation period. As the trees grow, investors share in the rewards. In the second year, an avocado tree may produce one fruit, but by the tenth, it can yield 300 to 400 kg (661–881 lbs), and considering today’s export prices, farmers can earn three times more than the domestic markets. What’s more, they don’t need to pay premiums on loans before generating revenue. Dimitra’s NFT launch begins with 1,000 avocado trees as a pilot in the fall of 2023, with plans to expand into mangoes, cocoa and other crops. By implementing blockchain and NFTs, Dimitra empowers farmers, investors and philanthropic sponsors in AgTech, demonstrating the transformative potential of this technology in agriculture.

    "fullContent": "Bitcoin transaction fees have soared above Ethereum’s amid a renewed appetite for Ordinals-inscribed assets.\nAverage daily transaction fees on Bitcoin (BTC) have flipped with Ethereum following a frenzy of Ordinals-related activity on the Bitcoin network. On Nov. 20, the average daily transaction fee for Bitcoin stood at $10.34, while Ethereum transaction fees came to an average of $8.43, according to BitInfoChart data. Bitcoin’s average daily trading fee notched a new six-month high on Nov.16, reaching a peak of $18.67, while Ethereum fees reached $7.90. The sudden uptick in Bitcoin transaction fees stems from a renewed market appetite for assets inscribed with the Ordinals Protocol — a tool for creating nonfungible token (NFT)-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin. Following a significant lull in activity between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23, Ordinals-based assets saw a drastic uptick beginning in late October, according to Dune Analytics data.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/free-to-play-web3-games-mass-adoption-ygg-gabby-dizon",
    "fullContent": "Gabby Dizon, the co-founder of Yield Guild Games, says a renewed focus on free-to-play gaming will help boost Web3 game adoption.\n2024’s most successful Web3 games will pivot from play-to-earn (P2E) to instead focus on being entirely free-to-play to attract players, says Yield Guild Games co-founder Gabby Dizon. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Dizon said unlike games such as Axie Infinity Classic — which require players to purchase at least three Axie nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to play — the new wave of hyper-successful Web3 games will seek to remove as many of the financial and technical barriers to entry as possible. “There’s an evolution of the business model where the games are free to play, and then at some point along the way while you’re playing, then you’re able to mint an NFT or start earning tokens, but a lot of new games aren’t really starting with requiring NFT ownership at the start,” he said. This shift toward a free-to-play model is part of a wider effort from Web3 game developers to put gameplay first and tokenomics second, Dizon explained. He added the shift forms a large part of the solution to speculative Web3 gaming bubbles. By creating games that players want to keep playing, they’ll reinvest their capital in the game and prevent the in-game economy from becoming a cash-generating machine, Dizon said. Running near-parallel to the decline in crypto prices, blockchain games witnessed their own downturn as players and revenues trickled out of the ecosystem following the sudden collapse in Axie Infinity-related asset values in late 2021. Surveys from October 2022 showed that even the most adamant crypto gamers were leaving in droves, citing the over-financialization of gameplay, lack of fun and confusion around crypto wallet tech. Dizon says all of that is about to change. “After Axie became popular two years ago, a lot of very experienced teams took a look at its rapid ascent and thought: ‘Now it’s a real industry, maybe I could do better by making my own game,’” he said. For the past 18 months, Dizon and other Web3 gaming industry leaders have eagerly awaited the launch of a series of new Web3 games in the fourth quarter of 2023, such as the Nov. 16 open beta Epic Games store launch of the blockchain-based trading card game Parallel. PRIME time is almost here. https://t.co/fXBVvboxx6 “Expect to see lots of really high-quality games, with high-quality teams behind them, as well as new experiments in tokenomics and earning models,” he said. Related: Blockchain game Illuvium goes mainstream with looming Epic Games Store listing Dizon pointed to the introduction of the ERC-6551 token standard or “token bound” accounts in gaming as a reason to be excited about blockchain-based games in the future, as some developers are using it to thread artificial intelligence (AI) into games. “You can actually start attaching AI behaviors to your avatar, and you can give it instructions: ‘I want you to go out to the world, craft me a gun, kill some monsters and then bring the treasure back,’ Dizon said. “Then, a few hours later, you can check the wallet that’s embedded in it, and it’s like, oh, I got these things back.” Dizon believes this kind of automation will greatly reduce the amount of “grinding” needed in games, allowing players to jump in for the fun parts while leaving the boring stuff to AI. “I think it’s going to be the start of a new game genre of you interacting with AI and not having to play the game all day,” he said. “You set parameters for the AI and just let it do things in the game world.” Magazine: Asia Express: No civil protection for crypto in China, $300K to list coins in Hong Kong?",

    "fullContent": "Explore the evolving world of NFT DApps: decentralized, blockchain-powered applications revolutionizing digital ownership and creative monetization.\nThe synergy between NFTs and DApps creates a dynamic ecosystem where digital ownership, decentralized finance and programmable assets converge, offering innovative solutions across various industries. Decentralized applications (DApps) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are two important components of the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems. Despite their disparate functions, there are several instances in which they coincide and enhance one another. For instance, NFTs can be used in DApps to signify ownership or access privileges for both real and digital assets. DApps can tokenize unique goods, such as in-game assets, digital art or real estate, by utilizing NFT standards such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155. NFTs are frequently used to represent in-game assets in gaming DApps. These assets are tradeable and buyable on secondary markets, which improves the idea of genuine ownership and compatibility across many virtual worlds or games. Moreover, DApps built specifically to create, manage and trade digital valuables have become popular due to the rise of NFTs. Tokenizing their creations allows artists and content creators to produce one-of-a-kind digital assets that consumers can purchase, sell and own. This has given creators new opportunities to interact directly with their audience while providing collectors with a safe and verifiable method of obtaining digital asset ownership. The programmable nature of smart contracts reinforces the convergence between DApps and NFTs. Smart contracts can be used by DApps to automate a number of NFT-related tasks, including content licensing, royalty distribution and even the implementation of dynamic features inside the NFT itself. The increased programmability of NFTs in decentralized applications improves their usefulness and functionality. Related: The different types of NFTs: A beginner’s guide Blockchain-based applications that integrate nonfungible tokens are known as NFT DApps. Using such apps, users can create, purchase, sell and trade original digital products, such as artwork, collectibles and in-game items. NFT DApps empower gamers, artists and content creators by utilizing the transparency and security of blockchain technology to transform ownership. The importance of NFT DApps lies in providing a decentralized marketplace, fostering peer-to-peer transactions, introducing innovative ownership forms, disrupting established sectors and democratizing access to the global digital economy. NFT DApps encompass a diverse range of platforms, each tailored to different facets of the digital and blockchain landscape. Artists tokenize their works as NFTs on platforms like OpenSea and Rarible, which act as marketplaces for people to purchase, sell and exchange their original digital assets. As centers of the emerging digital art scene, these platforms enable artists to claim ownership and value within the blockchain ecosystem. NFTs are used by DApps such as Decentraland and CryptoKitties to represent in-game objects, characters or items. These assets can be bought, sold and traded, creating a thriving virtual economy. The convergence of blockchain technology with gaming has resulted in the development of innovative concepts like play-to-earn, which allows users to earn money by engaging in blockchain-based games. Platforms for virtual real estate give NFTs a distinctive spin. In addition to developing and making money off of their virtual real estate, users can buy, sell and trade virtual land and property. This novel idea has sparked interest in user-owned, decentralized virtual worlds and raised the possibility of a new era in digital property rights. Marketplaces like Foundation and Mintable are an essential part of the NFT ecosystem, which provide artists and producers with the means to mint their NFTs and present them to a worldwide audience. These platforms act as intermediaries, bringing together creators and fans and fostering the general expansion of the NFT industry. In addition to the creative realm, NFTs have found applications in DeFi. DApps like Aavegotchi and Rarible explore the integration of NFTs as collateral within DeFi protocols. By allowing users to lend or borrow funds depending on the value of their NFT holdings, this innovative use case opens up new possibilities at the nexus of digital ownership and decentralized finance. Creating an NFT DApp involves a series of steps, as explained below: It is imperative that the team thoroughly establish the NFT DApp’s concept before beginning development. This entails describing the goal, intended user base and distinctive characteristics that will make the DApp stand out in the crowded NFT market. For developing an NFT DApp, choosing the right blockchain platform is a prerequisite. With its well-established infrastructure and broad support for NFT standards such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155, Ethereum is a well-liked choice. Alternatively, other blockchain platforms, such as BNB Smart Chain, may be considered based on specific project requirements. Install the required dependencies and tools to set up the development environment. This covers smart contract development kits, blockchain development frameworks and any additional tools needed for testing and scripting. Create the smart contracts that will govern the distribution, creation and ownership of NFTs. The terms and features of the NFTs, including minting, purchasing, selling and transferring, are outlined in these contracts. Integrate wallets to allow users to safely handle their NFTs. To enable users to engage with the DApp via their cryptocurrency wallets, this entails connecting with wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Develop the minting feature so that creators can tokenize their assets with NFTs. Developers need to design an intuitive user interface (UI) for creators and artists to easily upload their work, add metadata, and mint NFTs on the blockchain. This ensures a user-friendly platform navigation experience. Additionally, implement features for purchasing, selling and trading NFTs if the NFT DApp includes a marketplace. Incorporate features such as auctioning, bidding and real-time pricing adjustments. Users should be able to browse, purchase and sell NFTs with ease due to a user-friendly, entertaining UI. Consider adding functions such as filters, search and an easy-to-use wallet interface. Before deploying the NFT DApp to the blockchain, ensure the NFT DApp is thoroughly tested to find and fix any flaws or vulnerabilities. When satisfied, deploy the related files and smart contracts on the selected blockchain. This entails engaging with the blockchain network to enable global user accessibility for the NFT DApp. A strategic strategy is needed when launching an NFT DApp to spark interest and ensure a smooth launch into the market. Start by releasing well-crafted smart contracts over the mainnet to officially launch the NFT DApp. Plan a thorough marketing strategy at the same time to increase exposure. Create a captivating story that highlights the special value proposition of the NFT DApp and share it via a variety of platforms, such as forums, social media sites and cryptocurrency communities. To grow your audience and establish credibility, get in touch with influential people and thought leaders in the NFT industry. Establish a well-thought-out website that functions as a central information center and has guidelines and user-friendly interfaces to help new users get the hang of the platform. During the launch phase, it is imperative to implement a robust community feedback loop to resolve user complaints swiftly and promote a pleasant community climate. Following the launch, the team must implement an open line of communication with users, respond to their issues, and modify the DApp to adjust to changing market dynamics. Developing and launching an NFT DApp present myriad challenges. The main obstacle is technical scalability because of the growing demand and complexity of NFT transactions. It becomes imperative to ensure a smooth and effective user experience, necessitating creative solutions to deal with possible network congestion and sluggish transaction processing times. Security for smart contracts is crucial since flaws might have permanent effects on users and NFTs’ integrity. In addition, it can be difficult to stand out in a saturated market where several NFT DApps are competing for users’ attention. Another level of complexity is navigating legal ambiguities, particularly when it comes to intellectual property rights and regulatory compliance. To overcome these challenges, a careful fusion of technological know-how, security protocols, user-centered design and an acute awareness of the changing regulatory environment around NFTs is required.",

Skwarczek added that within this space, gamers will “find information about the best Web3 games” and “have the opportunity to buy and sell digital assets associated with these games.” Related: Roblox CEO \u0027dreams\u0027 of in-game cross-platform NFTs and digital objects Traditional gaming distributors have been warming up to Web3 gaming since 2023. In July, the Google Play Store started to accept NFT games with certain restrictions. According to its team, it will allow games that offer NFTs for sale or to earn. However, the app distributor has clarified that it will not allow gambling with NFTs within its platform. Apart from Google Play, video game developer and publisher Epic Games has shown openness regarding Web3 gaming. On June 22, the Epic Games Store listed Gods Unchained, an NFT collectible trading card game with comparable gameplay to popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. The game store is also on track to list another blockchain-based game called Illuvium on its game marketplace on Nov. 28.

Read about China’s stance on NFT theft and why the CEO of Roblox “dreams” of interoperability. In other news, find out what caused eye-related complaints at the recent ApeFest event in Hong Kong. Disney has partnered with NFT company Dapper Labs to launch a digital collectible platform called Disney Pinnacle. Using the platform, Disney will tokenize various characters from the Disney franchise, Pixar and Star Wars as digital collectibles. Fans can trade and collect digital pins once the NFT platform is fully released on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and for web browsers by the end of 2023. Continue reading Following a recent consistent upward trend in NFT sales volume, Cointelegraph reached out to various professionals working in the industry to get their thoughts on the recent rise in sales. Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of NFT marketplace SuperRare, said the trend will likely continue for the next six months. The executive believes the bear market is over, and things are finally turning around. Meanwhile, NFT platform Enjin’s chief financial officer, Oscar Franklin Tan, made similar comments and argued that NFTs have already been established as a unique class of digital assets separate from crypto. Continue reading In a statement published on Nov. 10, the Chinese government declared that those who steal digital collectibles like NFTs would be liable to face theft sentences. According to the announcement, stealing a digital collection intrudes upon the system, which means it also carries out the crime of illegally obtaining computer data and theft. While China has banned many crypto-related activities, various parties have expressed interest in diving into the NFT space. Continue reading Roblox CEO David Baszucki has recently expressed his dream of being able to move NFTs and objects across multiple platforms. The executive highlighted that he believes in this idea of users being able to move their collections to various non-native platforms. The Roblox executive also highlighted that various celebrities could sign up on Roblox and create and sell collectibles for charity if this dream was made into reality. According to the Roblox CEO, these collectibles could also potentially be sold in other marketplaces.

    "title": "New York MoMA now has tokenized artworks in its permanent collection",
    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-moma-token-art-nfts",
    "fullContent": "The museum’s acquisition of two NFTs marked its first on-chain and AI holdings.\nGenerative art is proving Web3’s creative anchor in the traditional art world. Last month, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) made headlines by acquiring Refik Anadol’s “Unsupervised — Machine Hallucinations” (2022) alongside an edition from last year’s “3FACE” project by Ian Cheng. These two mark the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) and nonfungible token (NFT) additions to MoMA’s collection, already home to relics such as Andy Warhol’s soup cans and Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.” The landmark acquisitions also supplement MoMA’s longtime legacy of pioneering exhibitions at the intersection of technology and art, from its 1968 show “The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age” through this year’s “Signals: How Video Transformed the World.” MoMA’s announcement arrived in tandem with an outline of the institution’s digital art programming for the fall and winter seasons ahead, including the debut of video artist Leslie Thornton’s latest work, “HANDMADE” (2023), and an online exhibition with Feral File opening early next year. Weeks before, MoMA had announced its on-chain Postcard project, too. “These new initiatives underscore MoMA’s longstanding commitment to support artists who experiment with emerging technologies to expand their visual vocabularies and creative exploration, increase the impact of their work and help us understand and navigate transformative change in the world,” the Museum’s release around their acquisitions states. “I’m very proud to be included,” Cheng told Cointelegraph. “MoMA had previously acquired my ‘Emissaries’ trilogy of simulations in 2017. Their openness and enthusiasm for acquiring dynamic digital art is rare for an institution.” It’s the screensaver heard around the world. Whether you’re enamored or suspicious of this one-time Google artist-in-residence’s prolific and mesmerizing machine-learning abstractions, the odds are you’ve seen them. Anadol designed this one in particular with help from Nvidia. It feeds 138,151 pieces of visual metadata from MoMA’s collection to an algorithm that produces an AI imagination of art history through Anadol’s signature undulations. Since its release in November 2022, “Unsupervised” has been reviewed by critics at Vulture, Artforum and more. The time it took to write those reviews says more than anything about the work’s import. Jerry Saltz’s half-baked hot takes don’t detract from the mental energy his writing requires. Haters alone haven’t made Anadol famous — he has scores of devoted fans if not collectors. MoMA opted to extend the work’s 24-foot tall display several times. It just came down on Oct. 29, but visitors who minted their proof-of-attendance protocol, or POAP, from the posted QR code still have a piece of the spectacle. Noted NFT collector and founder of the club 1 OF 1 Ryan Zurrer made the work’s acquisition possible, along with the “RFC Collection,” led by Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile and Desiree Casoni. “I tip my hat to the folks at MoMA for understanding the cultural zeitgeist of the moment,” Zurrer told ARTnews. “Unsupervised went up two weeks before ChatGPT went public. AI is the defining topic of the moment, and MoMA captured that. I’m excited to donate this work to MoMA. But I need to acknowledge that this isn’t just a donation from me and [collector] Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, but from Refik. He is bringing the servers and screens and the other components. The NFT is one part of this conceptual artwork that belongs to MoMA now.” While the Museum couldn’t clarify whether Anadol outright donated the hardware that enabled “Unsupervised” to go on view, we can assume that’s the case. Their release said Thornton’s “HANDMADE” will go on view in the same Gund Lobby where they displayed “Unsupervised” on a screen the very same size, “designed by and realized with thanks to Refik Anadol Studio.” Meanwhile, Cheng evades branding. A lifelong exploration of psychology through cutting-edge technologies defines his practice more than any single aesthetic. In fact, there are 4,096 unique editions of “3FACE” in existence, and not one of them was designed explicitly by Cheng’s hand. Works in the generative project depict adaptive, ongoing visual portraits of their owners, crafted using data gleaned from their wallets at any given moment. MoMA calls it his “most ambitious experimental artwork to date to explore blockchain technologies and the decentralization of data,” which expands upon “the artist’s interest in the capacity of humans to relate to change.” In his efforts to represent and shape the ephemeral mind, Cheng told Right Click Save last year he believes “art can play a role in upgrading the unconscious response we have to complexity.” “3FACE” honors the depths of every person — and, because it’s dynamic, their ability to change. The NFT platform Outland Art donated its “3FACE” to MoMA’s collection. “Jason Li and Chris Lew advised a lot and helped flesh out the team to turn the idea into a reality,” Cheng told Cointelegraph. “I would not have made ‘3FACE’ without Outland.” The work’s public entry on MoMA’s website doesn’t list what number out of the whole series it is or what wallet it belongs to. MoMA didn’t respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment, but based on the way “3FACE” works and the fact that MoMA just started collecting on-chain artworks, this might be the “3FACE” interpretation of a wide open wallet populated only by Anadol’s “Unsupervised.” Carrying the torch from former contentious and pioneering art forms like photography, generative art has forced this generation of artists to reassess what exactly makes art valuable. “The endgame of generative AI tooling is a new immediacy between thought and visual articulation,” Cheng mused about what’s next for AI art. “We’re used to the immediacy between thought and written or verbal expression. A writer, with no intermediary help, can construct a novel. Imagine if you, with no intermediary help, could construct a movie. As with writing fiction, the filmmaker is capped only by their own imagination, their taste, the quality of their questions, their courage to pursue gray truths, and their understanding of human behavior.” Technology will continually evolve, but it’s the evolution of artists’ abilities in using it that divides what’s merely eye-catching from what’s impactful. Not that those two are mutually exclusive — even though MoMA’s Anadol acquisition is akin to the institution buying itself a Louis Vuitton bag, what society calls luxury is history on its own. Anadol and Cheng both work predominantly with data while making AI art. The emergent properties of their processes have implications. “Unsupervised” begs the question: What is art history? — a fraught topic traditional art historians argue over without even breaching painting alone. By virtue of its premise, “3FACE” asks those who engage with it how they’d quantify a gnarled human psyche. It’s one of the few projects that uses the ledger as anything more than a manner of transacting. Museums such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Centre Pompidou started collecting NFTs back in the boom days. MoMA’s decision to lend credence to such works now marks a new watershed moment. “We pinch our nose at ‘AI art’ right now because the first experiments look like experiments, but zoom out 10 years from now,” Cheng said. “The ease of producing visually refined expression will unlock a lot of artistic agency from a greater plurality of people, and this is a good thing.”",

    "fullContent": "The pop-up nonfungible token store, co-sponsored by Weirdo Ghost Gang, will run until the end of the year.\nDairy Queen is partnering with local nonfungible token project Weirdo Ghost Gang (WGG) to create a pop-up NFT store in Chengdu, China. According to a press release seen by Cointelegraph, the “Ice and Snow Season” themed pop-up store is scheduled to run from Nov. 15 to Dec. 31 and will feature a variety of co-branded merchandise, such as a Dairy Queen-WGG themed ice cream. In addition, WGG NFT holders will receive exclusive perks as part of the joint venture. The project has a large following among users in the Asia-Pacific region. “Beyond merely showcasing Dairy Queen’s ongoing efforts in new media digital marketing, this collaboration also serves to offer consumers a more nuanced understanding of the NFT art IP, WGG, resulting in enhanced experiences and connections,” the release states. The WGG collection features 5,555 “Lil Ghosts” NFTs created by Hong Kong Web3 holding company ManesLab in 2021. The collection has surpassed 21,510 Ether (ETH) ($43.5 million) in trading volume since inception. Its current floor price is 0.485 ETH ($995.2). In September, WGG launched the “City Party Map - Shanghai Station” event with local food retailer Jiujiu Duck Neck to offer discounts for NFT holders at more than 500 of its retail stores. Last month, the project announced the “Ghost Season” event at Beijing’s affluent shopping hub The Box, displaying its NFT art on 3D screens for shoppers. Amid a severe crypto winter, many NFT projects have turned to partnerships with Web2 or even traditional brick-and-mortar firms for marketing collaboration. In March, the Wassies by Wassies NFT Collection opened a namesake pop-up hotel in Singapore. The hotel ran until September and offered Wassie-themed rooms for around $100 per night.",

According to social media reports, OpenSea users and developers have been targeted by various email phishing campaigns, including a fake developer account risk alert and a fake NFT offer. One OpenSea developer took to X (formerly Twitter) on Nov. 13 to report receiving a phishing attempt at an email strictly dedicated to their OpenSea Application Programming Interface (API) key. “In other words, dev contacts have been exfiltrated from OpenSea and are the real target in this campaign,” the post read. The social media report came in response to OpenSea’s insistence that the platform has not been hacked and urging users not to click on links they don’t trust. Correct- there is no smart contract vuln. But unfortunately for @opensea I just received a phishing attempt, to an email that was strictly dedicated to my OpenSea API key. In other words, dev contacts have been exfiltrated from OpenSea and are the real target in this campaign https://t.co/GD4UgwWIrx pic.twitter.com/rtyUJBMlwl Another OpenSea user took to Reddit to express confusion about the ongoing phishing campaign on Nov. 14. “Haven’t used OpenSea for years and all of a sudden, I keep getting emails talking about my NFT listings getting offers,” the poster wrote, adding that all the vulnerable links were trying to direct the reader to install a malicious app. “Right now I’m getting 3-4 scam/phishing emails a day which is crazy since I got zero just a few weeks ago,” the Redditor wrote, adding: The news comes a few weeks after one of OpenSea’s third-party vendors experienced a security incident that exposed information related to user API keys. OpenSea reported the breach in a notification email to affected users in late September 2023, stating that user emails and developer API keys may have been leaked due to the attack. Choose your third party well… Opensea posted that a vendor was attacked, resulting in the leak of developers\u0027 API keys! Get advice from a professional security consultant about the safety of the third party before choosing. E.g. @SlowMist_Team pic.twitter.com/jcBJ9IaAEN OpenSea users have received phishing emails previously. In February 2022, OpenSea officially confirmed that its platform faced a phishing attack from outside the OpenSea website and urged users to stay away from clicking on any links in the emails. The firm was also investigating rumors of an exploit associated with OpenSea-related smart contracts. Related: Chinese hackers use fake Skype app to target crypto users in new phishing scam OpenSea did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. This latest phishing campaign is happening just after OpenSea laid off 50% of its staff, with the stated intention of launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team. This attack is yet another reminder for the cryptocurrency community to stay vigilant when receiving emails from service providers. To avoid a phishing hack, users should be cautious of the email sender’s authenticity and the associated links. Users should also remember that crypto firms never ask their users for personal data like wallet addresses or private keys.

In a Nov. 14 statement, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York said French national Aurelien Michel pleaded guilty to executing a “rug pull” and admitted to defrauding investors out of $3 million in connection with the fraudulent Mutant Ape Planet NFTs. Nonfungible Token (NFT) Developer Pleads Guilty to an International Scheme to Defraud NFT Purchasers Aurelien Michel Conspired to Steal From Purchasers of “Mutant Ape Planet” NFTs Through False Promises and Misrepresentations@HSINewYork @IRSCI_NY https://t.co/K3CzIb8dQD According to Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors, Michel and his co-conspirators marketed the NFTs to investors by falsely promising them rewards and benefits designed to increase the demand for the collection. Prosecutors said Michel and his associates “intentionally failed to deliver on these promises, diverting millions of dollars’ worth of proceeds for their personal benefit.” “While Michel purported to sell dream NFTs backed with rewards and benefits, he defrauded investors, turning their dream into a nightmare of deception and losses,” said Thomas M. Fattorusso, special agent in charge of the Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation in New York. Michel was arrested in New York on Jan. 4, 2023, on charges related to the scheme. The DOJ said on Jan. 5 that Michel admitted to the NFT collection’s community via a social media chat that he perpetrated a rug pull and said, “We never intended to rug but the community went way too toxic.” Upon sentencing, Michel faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and has agreed to pay $1.4 million in restitution.

Chiliz Chain is the backbone of Socios.com, the platform that operates a plethora of fan tokens for some of the biggest global football and sports teams. Europe’s most loved football clubs and a number of household sports brands have tapped into the solution to power Web3 fan tokens and other blockchain-based offerings. Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu says the partnership presents an opportunity for his firm to combine its expertise in nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming with Chiliz’s focus on sports and entertainment-focused blockchain solutions. Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus adds that Animoca’s addition as a network validator marks a pivotal point in the firm’s history as it looks to solidify its position as a major blockchain solution primarily focused on catalyzing Web3 functionality and the wider sports industry. Animoca Brands becomes the latest validator of the Chiliz Chain, joining the likes of Ankr, Paribu, Meria, Luganoes and InfStones as validators. Similar to proof-of-stake blockchain protocols like Ethereum, validators authorize and enable the creation of fan tokens, NFTs and decentralized applications, as well as verifying transactions and executing smart contracts. Animoca has a wide-ranging spread of investments across the Web3 space and has also honed its focus on the sports sector. Its Web3 sports products include One Fight Arena, AFL Mint and REVV Motorsport. The latter includes the likes of MotoGP Ignition, MotoGP Guru, Formula E: High Voltage, REVV Racing and Torque Drift. Animoca grabbed headlines in April 2022 by acquiring French racing game developer Eden Games for $15.3 million. The deal aimed to acquire racing game development talent to enhance the REVV Motorsport ecosystem and introduce blockchain-based games focused on the genre. Chiliz launched its own layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain ecosystem to support its growth in Feb. 2023. The launch marked the transition away from its Ethereum-based ERC-20 token ecosystem to its own blockchain solution. The blockchain initially used a system of 11 active validators with proof-of-stake authority consensus, which is touted to provide faster block times, lower fees and energy usage.",

    "fullContent": "CoinW executive Sonia Shaw told Cointelegraph that the recent uptick in NFT sales shows a “broader and more profound interest” extending beyond art.\nIn the weeks leading up to November, nonfungible token (NFT) data showed a consistent upward leap in weekly sales. While the volume is still far from its peak in 2021, executives in the industry believe the upward trend will likely continue. On Nov. 6, data published by blockchain analytics firm Nansen showed that NFT sales volume leaped from $56 million in the week ending on Oct. 9 to $129 million in the week ending on Nov. 6. According to Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of NFT marketplace SuperRare, this trend will likely continue in the coming months. The executive believes that the worst has passed and is expecting upward swings shortly. He said: Perkins also believes that the downturn in NFTs was “purely sentiment.” The SuperRare co-founder told Cointelegraph in a statement that in the past 18 months, nothing “inherently went wrong” with NFTs. “NFTs are a fundamental advancement in the internet because they introduce traceable origin and ownership to digital objects. This unlocks a new online creator economy that can be 100x bigger than Web2,” he added. The executive also believes that in the long term, NFTs will be a big part of the online economy, and the space will see volumes that “eclipse those of the last cycle.” Commenting on the topic, Sonia Shaw, partner and vice president of partnership at digital asset exchange CoinW, said that the recent growth in NFT sales reflects a “broader and more profound interest” that extends beyond art and collectibles. Shaw told Cointelegraph that NFTs represent a significant shift in digital and physical asset management. She explained: Shaw also highlighted that potential use cases for NFTs could revolutionize industries such as identity management, real estate, healthcare, finance and supply chain logistics. While the executive believes in the role of NFTs in advancing digital ownership, Shaw also told Cointelegraph that it’s essential for players to also be mindful of the challenges. This includes regulatory considerations, environmental impact and security issues. Related: NFTs in the academy: Fighting fake credentials and unfair wages Meanwhile, Oscar Franklin Tan, the chief financial officer of NFT platform Enjin, echoed the sentiments. Making a case for NFTs, Tan highlighted that NFTs have already been established as a unique digital asset class entirely separate from crypto. The executive also told Cointelegraph that many investors entering the digital asset space back in 2021 were interested primarily in NFTs. Furthermore, Tan also pointed out that NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki have “remained intact” despite the bear market. As more investors enter crypto, they may also eventually dive into NFTs. “Renewed interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum will necessarily spread to blue chip NFTs and newer collections, including gaming NFTs,” Tan added.

According to the survey, 9.4% of the French population holds crypto assets, which is only marginally lower than those holding the most popular type of investment asset, real estate funds (10.7%). A further 2.8% of respondents possess nonfungible tokens. The survey also measured the group of “new investors” who have invested for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The new investors are mainly men (64%) and are significantly younger than traditional investors, with an average age of 36 versus 51 for the latter. In this category, 54% hold crypto assets. Related: French regulator sees DeFi as ‘disintermediated,’ not ‘decentralized’ The survey’s authors also noted that new individual investors have a “relatively low level of financial knowledge,” particularly those in the youngest group aged 18–24. They were more likely to give incorrect answers about the basics of investment strategy than traditional investors. The survey was conducted among 1,056 respondents in the spring of 2023, with 40 in-depth interviews about their needs and motivations.

It outlines three views on the type of crime that theft of digital collections falls under, the first two classifying it as either data or digital property. However, the statement stresses that the third view, which sees digital collections as both data and virtual property, would fall under the umbrella of “co-offending.” The statement explained that stealing a digital collection includes intrusion into the system on which it is housed, therefore also committing the crime of illegally obtaining computer information system data and theft. It elaborates on this topic, naming digital collections “network virtual property” and stressing that in the criminal law context, “collections should be recognized as property.” Related: 47 countries pledge to authorize the crypto-asset reporting framework by 2027 NFTs were specifically mentioned, establishing that digital collections are derived from the concept of NFTs “abroad” and use blockchain technology to “map specific assets” with “unique, non-copyable, tamper-preventing, and permanent storage characteristics.” The declaration said that, although China has not opened the “secondary flow market” for digital collections, “consumers can rely on trading platforms to complete purchases, collections, transfers, destruction and other operations to achieve exclusive possession, use, and disposal capabilities.” Despite China’s official ban from 2021 on nearly all crypto-related activity and transactions other than simply owning cryptocurrencies, there has been recent buzz surrounding NFTs. A local Chinese media outlet reported on Oct. 25 that the Alibaba-owned peer-to-peer marketplace Xianyu removed its censorship of “nonfungible tokens” and “digital asset” related keywords in its search. Prior to that, on Oct. 6 China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the Chinese government, announced that it wanted to create its own NFT platform and would award 2.813 million Chinese yuan ($390,000) to a third-party contractor to design the platform up to its specifications.

    "fullContent": "Roblox founder and CEO David Baszucki expects top brands and celebrities to take charge and play a key role in making the “dream” of cross-platform NFTs come true.\nThe frontman of the popular virtual universe game Roblox, David Baszucki, said he “dreams” of having the ability to move nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and digital objects across multiple platforms. Following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call, Roblox founder and CEO Baszucki spoke about the role major influencers play in fueling the widespread adoption of NFTs and digital collectibles in a recent CNBC interview. He believes in the idea of users being able to move their collections across non-native platforms: For example, Baszucki stated that A-list celebrities such as Elton John could sign up on Roblox and make and sell limited edition collectibles like capes for charity. These types of collectibles could go off the Roblox platform as an NFT and could be sold in other marketplaces. “What we do expect is that creators, whether it’s Elton John or Nike or someone else making a digital item, that they would play a key role and have a fair amount of control in that process,” Baszucki concluded. Roblox’s latest earnings call revealed a loss in Q3; however, the company recorded a 20% year-over-year growth in booking estimates on higher in-game spending and the total number of users.

    "fullContent": "The Bored Ape Yacht Club’s official Twitter account said an investigation confirmed suspicions that UV lights were the likely cause of the reported eye and skin issues suffered by some attendees.\nUltraviolet (UV) lights were the likely culptit behind the reported vision loss, eye pain and skin issues for at least 15 attendees of Yuga Labs’ ApeFest event in Hong Kong last week, the nonfungible token (NFT) conglomerate has confirmed. On Nov. 5, attendees began reporting eye and skin-related issues after attending ApeFest the day before — which was a free event for Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club owners held in Hong Kong. In a Nov. 9 X (Twitter) post, Yuga’s Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) account confirmed that “UV-A emitting lights installed in one corner of the event was likely the cause of the reported issues.” The BAYC said the determination came following a joint investigation with Jack Morton Worldwide, the agency that produced ApeFest, which conducted on-site inspections, testing, interviewed the events contractors and looked at equipment logs and specification sheets. On Sunday, November 5, Yuga Labs began to receive reports that some ApeFest attendees and staff experienced eye pain, vision issues, or skin irritation following the Saturday night community event. These reports were - and continue to be - deeply concerning to us.

The United States National Eye Institute says UV light exposure can potentially increase the risk of eye problems. UVA lights, better known as blacklights, are used for different purposes depending on their wavelength. UVA lights with lower wavelengths are typically used for suntanning beds, while lights with wavelengths closer to the visible light spectrum are used for special effect lighting such as in nightclubs. The BAYC did not disclose specific details about the kind of UVA lights used at ApeFest. Related: BAYC creator Yuga Labs completes restructuring to focus on metaverse The NFT project said it encourages those with symptoms to seek medical help and notify of their exposure to UVA lights.

    "fullContent": "Entrepreneur and the son of legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, Cordell Broadus (Champ Medici), explains what it takes to bring legacy artists into Web3 and build a new legacy in the future of music and gaming.\nThe Web3 industry has experienced massive growth in recent years, from a niche showing glimpses of the future of the internet to the reality of building that future with the brightest minds and makers. The space has also received support from several influential people, including big names from outside of Web3. Two of those people are world-famous rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg and his son Cordell Broadus, also known as Champ Medici. Over the past year, Broadus and Snoop have been at the forefront of combining Web3 technologies like nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the metaverse and blockchain with the music industry and its large community. In November 2022, alongside his other Web3-related projects, Snoop Dogg partnered with Billy Ray Cyrus to bridge music communities across genres and blockchain networks with a music NFT drop. \"Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus are launching a hip-hop country single with the new Animal Concerts NFT drop\"$ANML #NFTs #Bullish Read more about this on @RaritySniperNFT ⬇️ https://t.co/SC4d5n2Pg4 Broadus has been an essential part of bringing his father’s legacy to life in this new era of digital innovation. Cointelegraph sat down with him to understand what goes into bringing a legacy artist and communities into the Web3 space. He explained that in 2020, he was introduced to the metaverse, and shortly after that, his father was approached by Crypto.com. When collaborators brought up digital assets and NFTs in the studio, he recalled that no one understood the concept well enough to take it seriously. Broadus said he wanted to be a “bridge” to bring people into this space so that they could learn how to digitize their business and not rely only on the methods of the past. He felt a lot of musicians didn’t realize the potential of their unreleased music being, in some ways, equivalent to digital assets. When it comes to Snoop himself, Broadus said that his father had to trust his judgment. He recalled urging Snoop “for years” to recreate his first album, Doggystyle, which was released in 1993 by Death Row Records. He explained that over time, he believed the idea of rereleasing music “just kind of got embedded in [Snoop’s] head, so when the [NFT] idea came, he was super receptive to it.” However, this was something he and his team understood more clearly after launching a pilot on OpenSea, where Broadus and his team released 250 Snoop songs and sold the stems and the license to those songs. 1149 minted on 4/20 Price now goes up with every new mint Come N get yours Let Me Hit Somethin is just getting started ‍♂️ https://t.co/YIBhFh5eOe Broadus and the team started by releasing 500 copies of the single “High” for $500 each. “That first day we sold out and made $250,000 from that first single. From there, it was the numbers, and the numbers don’t lie. Then we only did it for 30 days and by the last 30th day, altogether we did $3.5 million,” he recalled. Related: AI can be a ‘creative amplifier’ — Grammy chief exec Harvey Mason Jr. Broadus explained how he witnessed many creators buy those songs and stems and turn them into EDM and country songs. He said that type of collaboration and creativity wouldn’t have been possible without NFTs and called the experience “uplifting.” This became even more real for Broadus when he attended NFT NYC and experienced firsthand musicians who bought the NFT song stems from the pilot. “To be able to be out in public in New York and hear like five different artists show me their songs that they bought from our pilot program and just see how happy they were to be able to be on the song with Snoop and other Death Row artists was huge for me. That’s what touched me the most.” He also recalled a moment at an event by The Sandbox earlier in 2023 where he was in conversations with big “decision-makers” in Web2 and Web3 and realized the importance of their efforts and presence in the space for their wider community. “I wanted to make it a priority and take it upon myself to show not just my father but all of the culture and ensure they were in that room because there was no representation. I was probably one of the only black kids in that room, and I wanted to make sure that I could change that.” Snoop, Broadus and the team behind their endeavors in the space have continued to move with this momentum with their latest venture announced on Nov. 6, Death Row Games, named after the legendary Death Row Records, which Snoop acquired in February 2022. Death Row Games is building off a new legacy, which was in part constructed by the teams’ gaming-related presence in the Web3 space, including Snoop’s Snoopverse in The Sandbox metaverse and Dr. Bombay with Yuga Labs, among others. He is bringing into gaming the same lessons he’s learned from bringing his and his father’s legacy into the Web3 space. “It’s the same ideology and mindset as far as bringing in diverse creators and telling stories from different parts of the world and minority communities.” Magazine: BitCulture: Fine art on Solana, AI music, podcast + book reviews",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/illuvium-epic-games-mainstream-listing",
    "fullContent": "Blockchain games have historically battled to gain mainstream attention, but Illuvium’s listing on the Epic Games Store could change the narrative.\nBlockchain-based game Illuvium is set to tap into an audience of millions of PC and mobile gamers with its upcoming listing on the Epic Games Store, which is home to massively popular titles like Fortnite. Illuvium, an interoperable blockchain game developed by Illuvium Labs, will feature on Epic’s store from Nov. 28, following several months of background work to get the title to meet its standards. Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph ahead of the Epic launch, Illuvium co-founder Kieran Warwick outlines the evolution of the game in order to cater to a mainstream audience and comply with the platform’s legal and compatibility requirements: The game was developed using Unreal Engine 5 on the Immutable X network. Its beta launch on Epic Games will feature three different game genres set within the Illuvium universe. This includes Overworld, an open-world exploration game and “creature capturer reminiscent of beloved classics,” an auto battler strategy game called Arena and Zero, and a mobile and desktop city-builder that ties into the other titles. Warwick says its approach of building separate genres and game modes aims to attract a wider audience of gamers. “By launching three different games in three different genres, we have significantly increased our addressable market. The only issue is it has taken much longer to get to this point,” Warwick adds. Given that blockchain games featuring nonfungible token (NFT) elements have struggled to break into the mainstream, Warwick’s team has adapted its approach to onboard more users. He highlights the barrier to entry for non-Web3 native gamers as a key reason for the slow adoption of blockchain games: As Cointelegraph recently reported, Web3 venture capital firms like Animoca Brands have highlighted the hesitance of mainstream game publishers to list games that incorporate Web3 infrastructure. Animoca Brands CEO Robby Yung previously suggested that mainstream players remain uncertain about the inherent implications, fearing that Web3 integration would bypass existing business models that rely on fees for distribution. Warwick echoes these sentiments, saying that this prevailing attitude is influenced by a variety of factors. One factor is game design integrity, with some critics suggesting that including NFTs could lead to pay-to-win mechanics or negatively affect the game design by prioritizing monetization over player experience. Regulatory concerns are another consideration, with Warwick highlighting that blockchain technology and NFTs remain “in a gray area in many regions.” The volatility of cryptocurrency markets and NFTs is another hurdle that concerns mainstream publishers, as well as the perceived prevalence of fraud. Nevertheless, Illuvium’s upcoming listing bodes well for the wider blockchain gaming industry. Warwick describes it as a major milestone as their title steps onto the same platform as some of the most popular mainstream games in recent years. “This is a huge step forward. People have been saying for years that Web3 gaming is the next big thing in the crypto space,” Warwick concludes. Web3 gaming investors have adopted a more measured approach to backing early-stage studios building blockchain games over the past year. This has been necessitated by the effects of a lengthy cryptocurrency bear market, which has called for greater due diligence from industry venture capitalists.",

Get ready for a non-fungible night in tomorrow\u0027s #TreehouseOfHorror XXXIV on @FOXTV, next day on @hulu. pic.twitter.com/Y4cSiyp4kD The special revolved around poking fun at the speculative nature of NFTs and how the market is largely fueled by the fear of missing out, FOMO. Once Marge discovers that Bart has become trapped on-chain, she too digitizes herself as an NFT. She battles her way through carriages on a virtual train — which is literally powered by FOMO — to rescue Bart, fighting NFT-themed characters all the while. The final joke lands when Homer finally gives into FOMO and mints himself as NFT. The second he does so, the train runs out of steam, and the prices of all the NFTs plunge to near-zero, ending the episode with his iconic catchphrase, “Doh!” Despite essentially being the punchline of an episode-long joke, the NFT community on Crypto Twitter reacted with delight, with Beeple saying that his work appearing on the show was a “bucket list moment” for him as an artist. Notably, The Simpsons’ creators even parodied their own NFT collection, Golden Moments, which was first offered in conjunction with Disney+ by the NFT platform VeVe in November 2021. “We saw that,” wrote the official account for Veve. We saw that @TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/nBAQEjJmyp NFT enthusiasts certainly didn’t let The Simpsons’ roast go to waste, with creators rushing to capitalize on the newfound publicity for NFTs.

Shpend Sahilu, the social lead for NFT company Yuga Labs, announced that he would be stepping down after antisemitic tweets he posted years ago resurfaced on social media. Sahilu, better known by the pseudonym NGBxShpend on X (formerly Twitter), explained that he would be leaving his role at the company due to his past antisemitic tweets becoming “a distraction” from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. “I want to apologize to anyone who I may have let down with tweets I made in poor taste,” he wrote in a Nov. 5 post on X. Hey everyone, tough day today. I am stepping down from my position at Yuga Labs. Some tweets have resurfaced from my past and it’s become a distraction from the Club and what we’re all about. These tweets do not reflect who I am or what I believe in. It has been an amazing… One user attached a screenshot of one of the offending tweets from 2016 in the comments section of the original post, showing him making a joke about Nazi leader Adolph Hitler. Yuga Labs, the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, has been accused of perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes in its artwork by controversial artists Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen. These accusations, which took the form of a knock-off NFT collection, led to a more than yearlong legal battle. However, Yuga Labs recently notched a legal victory against the provocative duo, with a court ordering Ripps and Cahen to pay $1.6 million in damages to Yuga Labs for copyright infringement. After a prolonged and continuous decline in NFT sales, the market seems to be finally showing signs of a recovery, with monthly trading volumes growing for the first time in a year, according to a report from crypto data firm DappRadar. “The year-long downward trend in NFT trading has been broken. Trading volume is up by 32% from $306 to $405 million, returning almost to levels seen in August,” the report reads. DappRadar found that NFT trading volume grew by $99 million in October compared with September, bringing overall trading activity back to levels slightly below that of August. Despite the seemingly significant increase month-over-month, it’s worth noting that October’s $340 million sum pales in comparison to the $1.98 billion in volume witnessed seven months prior in March. Regarding trading volume, Ethereum-based NFTs still dominated the market, growing more than 50% in October. Meanwhile, other networks such as Polygon, StarkWare and Flow saw their sales volume drop 48%, 42% and 32%, respectively. The report made special note of NFT activity on the Solana ecosystem, which — after being plagued by the FTX downfall — showed signs of strength, notching a 15% uptick in overall trading volume. Attendees of the Yuga Labs’ ApeFest event on Nov. 4 in Hong Kong have reported burns, damaged vision and “extreme pain” in their eyes, which they attribute to the use of improper lighting. NFT marketplace OpenSea announced on Nov. 3 that it would be laying off 50% of its total staff. Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer broke the news on X, saying the company was launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team.

    "fullContent": "Blockchain analytics company Nansen reported that NFT sales volumes reached 68,342 ETH in the week ending Nov. 6.\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) have seen a steady increase in terms of weekly Ether (ETH) sales volume, according to the blockchain analytics platform Nansen. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Nansen highlighted that on the week ending on Oct. 9, NFT sales were at 29,704 ETH, worth around $56 million at current ETH market prices. The sales volume increased weekly until it reached 68,342 ETH, worth over $129 million. NFT marketplace Blur had the highest share of NFT trading volume in the last 30 days. According to data aggregator NFTGo, Blur had a trading volume of 161,433 ETH (roughly $305 million) in the previous 30 days. Meanwhile, the second spot went to its competitor, OpenSea, which had 52,307 ETH in trading volume, or around $100 million. In terms of NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had the highest trading volume in the last 30 days. The BAYC collection had a volume of 35,226 ETH, or around $66.7 million. The collection was followed by the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) at 14,947 ETH and The Captainz at 9,948 ETH. CryptoPunks remained the top collection in terms of market capitalization. However, the collection only had a trading volume of 5,773 ETH in the last 30 days. Apart from these, NFTGo’s data also showed that there’s been a 12% increase in NFT traders in the last seven days. Buyer addresses were at 22,804, while sellers were at 27,308 in the same time period. Meanwhile, the number of wallets that held NFTs still hovered around six million.

Another ApeFest guest, who goes by the pseudonym Feld on X, described identical symptoms. A Yuga Labs spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they were aware of the situation and were taking it seriously; \"we are actively reaching out to and are in touch with those affected. We’re also pursuing multiple lines of inquiry to learn the root cause.\" \"Based on our estimates, the 15 people we’ve been in direct communication with so far represent less than one percent of the approximately 2,250 event attendees and staff at our Saturday night event,\" they added.

Related: Ryder Ripps ordered to pay Yuga Labs $1.6M in copyright lawsuit On Oct. 20, 2017, a number of attendees at a party thrown by streetwear brand HypeBeast reported painful burns and eye damage. It was revealed by the events’ DJ on Oct. 26 that the contractor tasked with setting up lighting at the party had used a series of Philips TUV 30W G30 T8 light bulbs, which, according to Philip’s website, emit 12 watts of UV-C radiation, mainly used for disinfecting surfaces. The reports of vision damage in both cases line up with a condition called photokeratitis, also known as “Welder’s eye.” The condition is caused by prolonged exposure to extreme levels of UV radiation, typically from artificial sources, such as welding lamps, but can also come from natural sunlight reflecting off bright surfaces such as snow, more commonly known as snow blindness.

    "fullContent": "This is the second layoff by the pioneering NFT marketplace after the crypto winter and a stubborn bear market for collectibles.\nNonfungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea announced on Nov. 3 that it was laying off employees. Co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer broke the news on X (formerly Twitter), saying the company was launching OpenSea 2.0 with a smaller team. OpenSea launched in 2017 when NFTs were an innovation. It operates on a model comparable to eBay and Etsy and accepts payment in Ether (ETH). It laid off 20% of its employees in July 2022, citing the crypto winter, after which it had a staff of 230, according to press reports at the time. A spokesperson at the pioneering marketplace told Cointelegraph by email: The spokesperson added that around 50% of employees would be affected across all functions and particularly mentioned that the number of middle managers would be reduced. The employees would receive four-month severance packages, accelerated equity vesting and six months of continued healthcare and mental healthcare. The market for collectible NFTs peaked in 2021. Since then, use cases such as tokenizing assets, identity and legal documents have gained popularity as the value of many collectibles declined. OpenSea was in the right place at the right time with the right product. But so was Tower Records. What can OpenSea do to maintain this lead they have? The answer is simple. Become a DAO, drop a governance token to users. It will be valued in the tens of billions. Everybody wins. OpenSea faced significant community pushback in August when it announced that it was retiring its operator filter, a feature that allowed creators to blacklist marketplaces that did not enforce royalties. Yuga Labs, creator of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks NFT series, began to taper off its use of OpenSea’s Seaport marketplace smart contract in response. “As we rebuild, we’ll continue supporting our existing products, and will be iteratively testing OpenSea 2.0 in public,” Finzer said in his X post. The company currently lists 12 open positions on LinkedIn, with starting salaries ranging from $90,000 to $270,000.",

A trader managed to exploit the brief opening of the Multichain cross-chain bridge, which was frozen since its exploit in July 2023, allowing the trader to turn $280,000 worth of Fantom’s (FTM) tokens into $1.9 million worth of different assets. In other news, Solana’s (SOL) token has surged 80% in a month, and Avalanche is set to shut down its Etherscan-powered blockchain explorer tool amid a fee controversy. A new bridged token from LayerZero has drawn criticism from nine protocols throughout the Ethereum ecosystem, claiming that it limits the freedom of token issuers. The top 100 DeFi tokens continue their bullish momentum from the last week, with most of the tokens posting positive returns on the weekly charts. A wallet address turned nearly 1.9 million FTM worth $280,000 to $1.9 million within hours of exploiting the long-frozen Multichain bridge opening momentarily, leading to insider job speculations among the crypto community. The Multichain bridge, frozen since its exploit in July 2023, opened briefly and closed again on Nov. 1. The trader seized the opportunity to make millions of dollars in profits.

A joint statement from Connext, Chainsafe, Sygma, LiFi, Socket, Hashi, Across, Celer and Router on Oct. 27 called the token’s standard “a vendor-locked proprietary standard,” claiming that it limits the freedom of token issuers. The protocols claimed in their joint statement that LayerZero’s new token is “a proprietary representation of wstETH to Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Scroll without support from the Lido DAO [decentralized autonomous organization],” which is created by “provider-specific systems […] fundamentally owned by the bridges that implement them.” As a result, it creates “systemic risks for projects that can be tough to quantify,” they stated. The protocols advocated for the use of the xERC-20 token standard for bridging stETH instead of using LayerZero’s new token.

On Nov. 3, the team behind the Ethereum-based metaverse announced on X (formerly Twitter) it had made The Sandbox Map accessible to everyone, where “LAND” owners can publish their own experiences without needing to partake in an application process (which was previously required). THE METAVERSE IS NOW OPEN Starting today, LAND owners in The Sandbox can instantly publish experiences on the map!

Sandbox said it will also update its Game Maker tool before 2024, its experience-building and testing tool that is set to introduce new gameplay mechanics, templates and social interactions to make content production even easier. The firm will also “reignite” its new 100 million SAND Game Maker Fund (currently worth $36 million) in 2024 to build on those updates. Borget said this will drive engagement across a range of industries: Borget said Game Maker’s tools have simplified the process for new creators to get started: Meanwhile, Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid said the firm has helped connect brands to fans of late by running contests to rebuild New York’s Times Square and architectures in The Walking Dead, among other things. The firm is working to incorporate multiplayer capabilities, which will drive this audience engagement.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-platform-enables-nft-creation-with-email-why-its-important-for-legal-teams",
    "fullContent": "An award-winning Web3 platform helps law firms and insurance companies enter Web3 and protect their customers by turning email communications into blockchain-verifiable NFTs.\nOn top of the fraud and scam issues related to crypto, NFTs also require intellectual property management. Web3 platform Niftyz aims to add legal clarity to the NFT market by using blockchain-verified emails to create and protect NFTs. The crypto industry is growing remarkably, even in the cornerstones of traditional finance. Take the United Kingdom, for example, where crypto asset holders jumped from 2.1 million in 2021 to almost 5 million in 2022, according to a report released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). However, it’s hard to say that the growth was all moonlight and roses. As highlighted in the same FCA report, nearly 80% of crypto asset owners do not know who to approach when they have a complaint. This is particularly concerning given the skyrocketing crypto-related fraud losses, which have increased by 41% in the U.K. in the past year, with the FTX collapse being a major contributor to this problem. The legal landscape faces increasing challenges due to the rise of tech and innovation-related fraud, as well as unmet legal needs. According to LSB research, 3.6 million people in England and Wales have unmet legal needs each year. This includes crypto and its subsectors, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The rising demand for legal services in the crypto industry is opening up a new market for lawyers. However, the legal system is struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the crypto space. Why is this? The main reason is that crypto-related innovation is, by nature, complex and constantly evolving. For example, the legal aspects of NFTs are challenging to understand. This makes it difficult to determine what the buyer is getting, what the seller can claim after the purchase, or who owns which rights. This uncertainty is a major problem for the NFT market.  NFTs come in various forms, making them complicated to manage from a legal standpoint. To top it off, the lack of regulatory supervision causes fraud and scams to run rampant in the market, causing newcomers to get even more confused about the credibility of NFTs. In such an environment, even simple tasks such as launching a new NFT collection could become an uphill battle when you factor in the legal support that would be needed in case of IP theft or trademark infringement. Niftyz, a Web3 infrastructure platform backed by Brinc and Animoca Brands, launched a new NFT minting service called Niftyz Send to address the legal concerns in the NFT creation process. Designed as a user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses, Niftyz Send also streamlines processes for law firms and insurance companies, helps them handle the growing number of crypto fraud cases, and enhances access to justice in general.  Niftyz features a user-friendly interface for email-based NFT creation. Source: Niftyz Since launching a new NFT collection can be a daunting task for Web3 newcomers, Niftyz Send takes a Web2-friendly approach instead by using the familiarity of email connection for minting. Users can transform emails into unique and traceable digital tokens, attach any type of content to them, and mint NFTs with the simplicity of sending a standard email.  Once registered with their emails, users can send and receive blockchain-certified messages as NFTs. Source: Niftyz Niftyz enables sending NFTs to either wallet or email addresses straight from the email inbox, bringing Web2 platforms into the Web3 era. By simply tokenizing creative work, intellectual property, legal proceedings, insurance policies or sensitive documents, Niftyz Send simplifies IP protection.  Each email gets a transaction ID on the blockchain, which can be publicly checked via a Block Explorer. Source: Niftyz The platform creates a transparent communication trail for legal proceedings by providing a verifiable source of evidence. Law firms can use Niftyz to send cease and desist letters to creators of unauthorized NFT campaigns, helping to fight against trademark infringement or send legal proceedings to wallets for fraud-related cases. Niftyz also offers public and private dashboards that allow users to keep the content of their NFTs hidden. Additionally, users can tokenize and record legal documents on the blockchain to create an immutable notarization record. Commenting on the state of Web3 and how it can be improved, Sara Simeone, CEO and co-founder, and Sebastiano Cataudo, chief technology officer and co-founder of Niftyz, told Cointelegraph: “We see Web3 as a powerful tool capable of reshaping how users and businesses engage, discreetly enhancing communication for increased seamlessness, accountability and transparency. We are committed to making Web3 a seamless technology embedded in our day-to-day life.” Serving as a user-friendly entry point to Web3 and legal technology, Niftyz Send enables hassle-free interaction with blockchain technology for individuals and law firms, mitigating complexities and making NFT adoption accessible to all. By addressing the limitations and challenges posed by the legal landscape, Niftyz Send paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and accountable legal processes, ultimately enhancing access to justice and reducing unmet legal needs.

    "fullContent": "Sanjay Raghavan believes that the tokenization of real estate could bring Web3 adoption and provide a diversification alternative for crypto natives.\nThe tokenization of real-world assets has been tipped as a major use case of blockchain technology that could drive Web3 adoption. In episode 35 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw interviews Sanjay Raghavan, vice president of Web3 Initiatives at Roofstock onChain, about tokenized real estate on the blockchain and how digital real estate investing interacts with the nonfungible tokens market and the decentralized finance landscape. Raghavan also talks about fractional nonfungible tokens (NFTs), regulations and the risks related to Web3 real estate platforms. Raghavan explains how real estate is sold on the blockchain using NFTs. Companies that sell real estate on-chain must first purchase the property and create a limited liability company (LLC). An NFT is then created, which is associated with the ownership of the LLC. When users buy the NFT, they buy the LLC, which means they have purchased the property. Raghavan tells Hashing It Out that regulations for tokenizing real-world assets can be complex. In the United States, for instance, various states have rules on the sale of assets, meaning that com navigate separate compliance requirements across 50 jurisdictions. Beyond bringing people from the traditional real estate market to Web3, Raghavan believes that crypto natives may see real estate tokenization as a diversification tool. He explains that most investment alternatives in the industry may be highly correlated to the Bitcoin (BTC) price, and having another stable and less correlated asset could be a reason for exposure to real estate NFTs. Raghavan also talks about the fractionalization of assets, including NFTs, which may require running a securities program that makes it unattractive for companies working in the United States. On the other hand, non-U.S. citizens may be able to access fractional NFTs in the future if firms outside the jurisdiction buy properties and sell the NFTs in other markets.

    "fullContent": "Elon Musk argued that NFT projects “should at least encode the JPEG in the blockchain,” to the delight of many Bitcoiners.\nWhile publicly mocking nonfungible tokens (NFTs) during a podcast, Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk appears to have inadvertently highlighted the case for Bitcoin Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs. “The funny thing is the NFT is not even on the blockchain — it’s just a URL to the JPEG,” said Musk in an Oct. 31 released interview on The Joe Rogan Experience. Musk said NFT projects should at least encode the JPEG on-chain: On social media, Bitcoiners argued Musk’s comments actually summed up the use case for Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin’s version of NFTs was launched in January by developer Casey Rodarmor, which was made possible by the Taproot soft fork in November 2021. Cryptocurrency analyst Will Clemente was among those who praised Musk’s comments, noting there are 38 million and counting Ordinals inscriptions that will forever exist on Bitcoin’s blockchain. .@elonmusk you just laid out the case for Bitcoin ordinals - image/text inscriptions directly on the most secure open source monetary network on the planet. There are currently 38 million of these inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain. pic.twitter.com/WASj1qpkz8 “This is why Ordinals will continue to grow,” said Rohun “Frank” Vora, the creator of NFT projects DeGods and y00ts. “It’s the most elegant solution to one of the most universal criticisms of NFTs.” Ordinals developer known as “Leonidas” liked Musk’s comments so much that they inscribed the 19-second video into Bitcoin’s blockchain at block 814,773: The criticisms from Musk toward NFTs aren’t new. In December 2021, he mocked NFTs as a sign of mental illness in a meme showing a patient lying on a therapist’s couch. pic.twitter.com/Wv6iJDuTge Musk’s comments, however, don’t stand true for all NFT projects on Ethereum. For example, Larva Labs moved its CryptoPunks NFTs on-chain in August 2021 after they lived off-chain for the first four years. “Storing them on-chain in this way would further cement the long-term survival of the Cryptopunks images and attributes, and ensure that they can be fully accessed by anyone with only an Ethereum client,” Larva Labs said in the statement. .@elonmusk is correct that having NFT merely provide an http link to someone\u0027s domain is silly. However, with rare exceptions, it\u0027s also silly to insist NFT content be on chain, IPFS links, with the content backed by whoever owns the NFT is the natural solution. Related: Are NFT markets in a death spiral or ready for a resurgence? Metagood, the team behind the Ethereum-native OnChainMonkeys, announced in September that it would migrate its NFTs to Bitcoin. While the firm’s CEO, Danny Yang, didn’t directly address the JPEG dilemma, he explained that NFTs “will win on Bitcoin” because it is a securer network to work from: However, Ethereum still remains home to 84% of all NFT trading volumes, according to CoinGecko, sourcing data from June. Bitcoin and ImmutableX came in second and third with market shares of 11% and 2.5%, respectively.

The sale lasted only 48 hours, with two physical versions of the CryptoPunks being offered. The first is called “Punk-On-Chain,” exclusively for the owners of the punks, and the second is called “10,000 On-Chain,” which is a print collection of all 10,000 CryptoPunks open to anyone.

The German postal service will release its first limited-edition collectible stamp on Nov. 2, 2023, combining NFTs and artificial intelligence. German automotive company Mercedez-Benz launched its third NFT collection, The Era of Luxury, in September.

    "fullContent": "“It’s not just a piece of artwork”: Mintable CEO Zach Burks argues that the United Kingdom government still hasn’t caught up on what NFTs are becoming.\nThe United Kingdom’s government is in danger of regulating nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in a way that doesn’t suit the true nature of the nascent technology, says Mintable CEO and founder Zach Burks. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Burks said he believes a recent report from a U.K. parliamentary committee significantly exaggerates the role NFTs play in copyright infringement and fails to recognize that they are more than just volatile digital pictures. “NFTs are in a transition phase where they’re moving away from the speculative boom of PFPs, and now it’s going into utilities of brands implementing NFTs across a whole range of different things,” Burks explained. In the Oct. 11 report, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee urged the government to take action to protect artists and content creators from copyright infringement associated with NFTs. NFT marketplaces need to do more to address the scale of copyright infringement on their platforms. We\u0027ve published our report on \"NFTs and the Blockchain: risks to sport and culture\". Find out more: https://t.co/4pYE6gAngw Read our report: https://t.co/XIj0LYlcrX@cj_dinenage pic.twitter.com/GTbtOJCM8m Burks acknowledged that copyright protections and intellectual property rights for artists are of paramount importance, pointing to Mintable’s own IP protection algorithm it uses to prevent plagiarism on its platform. However, he explained that while these issues should be a top priority for all NFT platforms, they’re not exactly NFT-specific concerns. “Regulators say, ‘Well now, NFTs are being used for copyright infringement.’ Well yeah, so is WordPress. So is YouTube. So is Spotify,” he said. “And how do you combat that? Well, you have some of the largest, most advanced companies in the world, like Google, working on this.” Burks, who personally corresponds with U.K. government officials on NFTs on a weekly basis, said that while NFT platforms should be doing their utmost to protect artists, it falls on regulators to embrace a more nuanced view of NFTs as a whole. Was such a great time speaking at the 40th International Symposium on Economic Crimes at Cambridge University in the UK! Learned so much, met some amazing people, and hopefully educated the people who listened to my many panels about NFTs and the blockchain space! pic.twitter.com/txExSVqTIb “There are so many ways that you can utilize NFTs, whether it’s for your car records, for your property records, whether it’s a bank settlement document, whether it’s a backup layer, whether it’s a full supply chain system or a biofuels company,” he said. “If my website is used to sell books, I’m governed by the laws that are used to sell books. If I sell drugs on my website, then you don’t need new laws. I’m still just selling drugs, right?” he said. In Burks’ view, NFTs are an extremely broad technology capable of a vast array of different functions, and having a committee declare that they be regulated as pieces of digital art could be a significant setback to unveiling the true utility of the technology. “The [committee] said the government should implement the EU 17 copyright directive on NFTs, which is bad in the sense that it’s a really broad umbrella,” he said. Related: NFTs aren’t dead — they’re just resting In the report, the committee said the “most pressing issue” raised by NFTs was the risk to artists’ intellectual property rights arising from the ease and speed at which tokens can be minted. It suggested they be regulated under a relatively narrow copyright directive: Article 17 of the European Union Directive on Copyright. “When you say all NFTs need to have this one element of regulatory coverage, this is the equivalent of saying, ‘We need this one piece of legislation that covers this piece of technology,’ which might’ve started at the Edison light bulb but now we’re dealing with Teslas,” Burks said. Ultimately, Burks believes the U.K. government could take some notes from regulators in Singapore, where the government judges NFTs by their specific use cases. “Regulators in Singapore look at what an NFT actually is, and then they go from there,” he explained. “Say you’ve got an NFT of a Tesla stock. Well then, that’s a security. Oh, this is an NFT of a bag of cocaine that’s facilitating the sale of drugs? Then they regulate the same way they would illicit drugs.” Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 \u0026 crypto gaming, Formula E",

The conventional social media landscape often overlooks fair revenue distribution and user control. However, innovative platforms are being developed to merge social interactions with financial incentives, creating a more equitable social media ecosystem for both content creators and consumers. Pop Social is an AI-powered social gateway to Web3. The platform explores a new approach to social media where users create and share their content, interact with each other, and get rewards with native Pop Tokens for active engagement with the app. AI algorithms are used in the content creation features and in the process of generating individual post feeds. Pop Social has already reached over 250,000 downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store and has over 40,000 daily active users. ReadON is a social app with a Web3 sharing economy where content is owned by creators, and part of the ad revenue is distributed back to them.

More than 50 universities have already partnered with Talentre, and the platform has reached over 170,000 registered wallets and over 50 business clients, including Circle, BNB Chain, Solana, and many others. Monetization and user engagement are pressing challenges in the entertainment sector. By embedding blockchain technology in streaming and gaming platforms, these innovative projects are crafting a rewarding and engaging entertainment ecosystem for modern audiences.

    "fullContent": "German brands embrace NFTs, exploring new ways to engage with customers and build brand loyalty.\nFor the most part, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have two primary use cases: Buying and selling digital products (digital art, virtual fashion items) and building digital communities (exclusive memberships, access to events). These use cases can be easily adopted by brands and companies, such as fashion brands selling digital clothes, various companies offering NFT-based club memberships and musicians holding exclusive concerts for their fans. Traditional German companies are also jumping on the bandwagon, recognizing the potential of NFT technology to innovate and market their products and services. Deutsche Post, the German postal service, will release its first limited-edition collectible stamp on Nov. 2, 2023. A classic self-adhesive stamp will come with a digital image — an NFT representing ownership of the stamp. The first stamp features a pixellated image of the Brandenburg Gate generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Upcoming stamps in the collection will feature other iconic German landmarks. It remains to be seen whether the NFT stamp collection will be a commercial success. However, it is a significant step for Deutsche Post, which is looking to expand its reach into the digital world. Erste offizielle Deutschland-#Krypto-#Briefmarke kommt. Mehr: https://t.co/IqcouOeygG pic.twitter.com/XS4y5nkFCo NFTs can also be used for various loyalty programs, offering customers a more rewarding and engaging experience while providing businesses with a new way to connect with their customers and build brand loyalty. An example of such a program is Lufthansa’s NFT loyalty program on the Polygon network. In collaboration with Lufthansa Innovation Hub and Miles \u0026 More, its frequent flyer program, Lufthansa has developed the Uptrip mobile application that allows passengers to turn their travel experiences into NFTs. These NFTs can then be redeemed for rewards such as mileage bonuses and business lounge vouchers. Lufthansa\u0027s @Uptrip_app loyalty program is building #onPolygon to turn flights into rewards Collect NFT trading cards for every flight and claim rewards Learn more about the new Miles \u0026 More and @LHInnovationHub experience: https://t.co/MjQihK8xUx pic.twitter.com/JfUEoUJxNR According to Christopher Siegloch, head of program development and services at Miles \u0026 More, the app has already generated significant interest among Lufthansa customers. Since its launch, over 20,000 users have registered, and more than 200,000 collectible cards have been issued. Siegloch highlights that gamification elements play a crucial role in introducing participants to Web3 technologies like NFTs, and the app successfully translates the enthusiasm for collecting into the digital realm. Furthermore, in the second half of 2023, the app will introduce a digital marketplace where users can trade and sell their NFTs, with special NFT reward offers planned for the future. NFTs are also reaching out to fashion brands. For example, German apparel company Adidas continues to refine its Web3 strategy by actively using NFTs to find new ways to engage with its community of athletes, sneakerheads and sports enthusiasts. Recently, Adidas introduced a series of limited-edition NFT sneakers inspired by their iconic footwear designs. These digital sneakers can be showcased in virtual environments, allowing users to express their love for the brand in the metaverse. Adidas is also discovering new ways to use the full potential of NFT to encourage its community. The last example is The Adidas /// Studio, or Triple Stripes Studio, which launched a Web3-based digital artist-in-residency program to showcase and support budding creators in the NFT space. According to Adidas, the goal is to support and nurture creative talents in the digital realm, providing artists with an opportunity to showcase their work and collaborate with the sportswear giant. This collaboration extends beyond digital projects and may include physical products in the future. Another German fashion brand, Hugo Boss, has also entered the NFT arena with a focus on fashion in the metaverse. The company collaborated with renowned digital fashion designers to create a series of exclusive NFT clothing items. These digital fashion pieces can be worn by avatars in virtual worlds, allowing users to dress in style even in the digital realm. Mercedes-Benz boasts a rich history spanning more than 130 years, attracting a dedicated following of nostalgia enthusiasts and collectors. The brand’s iconic models, vintage cars and related artifacts, whether in their original form or as miniature models and toys, continue to hold appeal. In line with its strategic direction, the German automaker is venturing into the Web3 space through the launch of Mercedes-Benz NXT to enhance its engagement with the community. In September, Mercedes-Benz launched its third NFT collection: The Era of Luxury. These collectibles created by Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons are digital reinterpretations of the most remarkable designs from seven design eras. The collection spans from the present day to the early history of automobiles. 1/ What a fantastic reveal on Wednesday! In this thread, we would like to show you a selection of combinations of the Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons from “The Era of Luxury”. Let us start with Mercedes-Benz NXT Icons #41 collected by Pakwalker. ↓ pic.twitter.com/ogyubfA9M8 All three NFT collections show how Mercedes-Benz actively explores opportunities to blend the digital realm with automotive design. This endeavor is spearheaded by the brand’s chief design officer, Gorden Wagener, who guides the Mercedes-Benz design team in creating digital collectibles. The primary objective is to reinterpret the brand’s most iconic designs, presenting them in the digital format of NFT cards. Ritter Sport, a German chocolate brand, also ventured into the NFT world by launching a limited series of digital chocolate bars as NFTs in August 2023. The NFT collection is called Art of the Square and consists of 256 digital pixel art pieces, each depicting a square Ritter Sport bar. gm! Ganz im Sinne von Clara Ritter haben wir eine Kollektion an Digital Collectibles entworfen: „Art of the square“ geht am 23.08. um 16 Uhr in den Verkauf, die Allowlist ist schon online!

Other German food brands have also released their NFT collections. For example, confectioner Katjes released its NFT collection of three unicorn babies named Dash, Willow and Sparkles in April 2023. This was Katjes’ second NFT campaign after releasing a limited-edition collection of 777 unicorn NFTs in May 2022. Both campaigns were a way for Katjes to reach a younger audience, as unicorn babies are a popular character among children and teenagers. Haribo, a German confectionery company famous for its gummy bears, has also entered the NFT world. In April 2023, the company filed for NFT trademarks in the United States, indicating its plans to expand its brand into the digital world. The trademarks cover a wide range of digital assets, including digital avatars, multimedia files with confectionery-related artwork, cartoons and other items authenticated by NFTs. German confectionery company #HARIBO has registered its name as a trademark for: ✅ Smartwatches ✅ VR Glasses ✅ Media verified by NFTs ✅ Jewelry and Toys ... and much more!#NFT #MetaverseNFT #GoldBears #Trademark #Candy #NFTs #VR pic.twitter.com/y7WqNVJC7c Adidas, Haribo, Lufthansa, Deutsche Post and other traditional German brands have joined the growing list of businesses venturing into the NFT space. This expansion marks a significant shift in the perception of NFTs, as they are no longer viewed solely as a niche investment opportunity. Instead, NFTs are increasingly being seen as a mainstream marketing tool and a way to experiment with new concepts that bridge the virtual and physical worlds and build new communities.",

    "fullContent": "Fanton brings blockchain-based fantasy football to Telegram thanks to the IM service’s recent integration with the TON blockchain.\nWhat’s a better way than combining the world’s most popular sports with Web2’s most socialized aspects to introduce new users to Web3 through gaming? Association football, or soccer, boasts the largest fan base among sports enthusiasts, with over 3.5 billion estimated people rooting for their favorite teams. Built mainly for football fans, the fantasy sports industry, a vast network of virtual sports leagues where users can create their own teams, has also grown to become a $25 billion global market. Mixing fantasy football with blockchain features like nonfungible token (NFT) cards could create an ideal entry point to Web3 for the masses. However, current platforms present complex mechanics for newcomers, and most of them lack in-platform user interaction —a big loss considering the social aspect of fantasy football. Fanton has built a fantasy football game that is integrated into Telegram to benefit from the instant messenger service’s 800 million-strong user base. It features collectible cards of top football players that earn points according to their real-life performances. These cards are issued on the blockchain as NFTs and can be easily traded among players. The game benefits from Telegram’s recent integration with The Open Network (TON) blockchain, which enables the use of a noncustodial wallet directly from the Telegram app. Users can create a virtual football team with their cards of players, and earn points for their players’ actions in the real world. The teams are made of five players: a goalkeeper, a defender, a midfielder, a forward and a substitute player. These players earn points based on their performances in their real-life football matches. Points are awarded for various actions, such as goals, assists and saves of goal chances by the goalkeeper. The combined score of the points equals the team score. Tournaments are organized based on match days of real football leagues, including the English Premier League, Spanish LaLiga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A and the French Ligue 1. Players can partake in a special championship consisting of the most important matches from the five European leagues, the Brazilian Championship and the UEFA Champions League, the world\u0027s most prestigious championship. Users can join these tournaments by paying a participation fee, of which 85% is added to the prize pool while 15% goes to Fanton. Teams that score more points than others are rewarded with TON coins and collectible cards.  Fanton features soccer superstars as NFT cards. Source: Fanton Cards are divided into rarity classes based on their scarcity, giving them value and uniqueness. Non-NFT cards are classified as common, while NFT cards can have rare, epic and legendary rarities. The game is free to play and provides common cards without charge for everyone who wants to participate. The rarer NFT cards should be purchased to take part in special NFT tournaments with higher prizes. Fanton became a part of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program with its straightforward product that is already showing good traction in user onboarding and revenue. The Cointelegraph Accelerator team was inspired by the innovative game-in-a-messenger format, easy user onboarding and the perspective of crypto adoption via messengers. The platform has over 350,000 users and surpassed $40,000 in monthly revenue. With a seasoned team of 15 based in Spain and Indonesia, the game managed to raise $300,000 in a pre-seed round in February. Today, October 27, 2023, Fanton launched its product on Product Hunt, a platform where users can discover and upvote new products. Fanton encourages its supporters to visit Product Hunt on Friday and upvote the product.",

    "fullContent": "The NFT artists were also ordered to cover Yuga Labs’ legal fees after determining the trademark infringement constituted an “exceptional case.”\nA United States district court judge has ordered nonfungible token (NFT) artists Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen to pay Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs a total of $1.57 million in disgorgement and damages, along with legal fees, bringing an end to the long-running “copycat” NFT lawsuit. The Oct. 25 order follows an April 21 partial summary judgment granted in favor of Yuga Labs after the firm claimed that Ripps and Cahen, the defendants, violated copyright laws by making copycat versions of its Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collectibles. District Court Judge John Walter awarded Yuga Labs $1.37 million after concluding the NFT firm was entitled to a disgorgement of the defendants’ profits. An additional $200,000 was awarded in statutory damages relating to cybersquatting violations. Yuga Labs v. Ryder Ripps et al - Notes from the Court\u0027s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Yuga is awarded $1,375,362.92 in Ds profits, $200,000 in statutory damages, and attorneys\u0027 fees and costs (amount TBD). A permanent injunction is also issued against Ds. 1/ pic.twitter.com/2dTiuWpZSA Yuga Labs has also been entitled to recover attorney fees and costs from the NFT artists after the judge determined the trademark infringement constituted an “exceptional case.” “A trademark case is generally considered exceptional for purposes of awarding of attorneys’ fees when a party has taken positions that can be characterized as ‘malicious, fraudulent, deliberate or willful,’” the judge noted. Judge Walter also knocked back the defendants’ argument that the copycat BAYC versions were “satire” and “parody,” ruling that the defendants intentionally infringed Yuga’s BAYC trademarks with a bad faith intent to profit from them. He also noted the defendants continued to market and promote their copycat BAYC versions after the partial summary judgment was delivered against them in April. Yuga Labs filed the lawsuit against the two artists in June 2022. In an Oct. 16 hearing in a United States appeals court, Ripps and Cahen’s lawyers tried to argue the lawsuit should be thrown out on the grounds of free speech under California’s anti-SLAPP statute. However, the three-judge panel didn’t appear persuaded by the lawyer’s arguments.

It began on Oct. 26 at 3:00 pm UTC and will end on Oct. 28 at 3:00 pm UTC. Our print collaboration with @avant_arte is officially live – for 48 hours only. Punk On-Chain is available exclusively to CryptoPunk holders at https://t.co/skT1FKTJgB pic.twitter.com/X657IqdgUT Two different versions of the physical CryptoPunks collection are being offered on Avant Arte. The first is called “Punk-On-Chain.” Each punk owner can commission a Punk-on-Chain print copy for each digital CryptoPunk they own. However, users will need to prove ownership to commission a print copy. This means that individuals who do not own the on-chain version cannot buy its print version. The second collection is called “10,000 On-Chain,” which is a print collection of all 10,000 CryptoPunks that’s open to anyone. Collectors can buy the print version of a 10,000 On-Chain Punk even if they don’t own the original on-chain version. The two different versions of each printed punk are distinguishable from each other by a variety of characteristics. For example, the 10,000 On-Chain pieces are archival pigment prints with a silkscreen varnish seal, whereas the Punks-On-Chain pieces are UV pigment prints with white underpins. Both versions of each punk contain a Yuga Labs holographic sticker to prove their authenticity. The Punks-On-Chain items also feature a QR code on the back of the print, leading to a blockchain-based digital Certificate of Authenticity (CoA). As for the 10,000 On-Chain pieces, they ship with a physical CoA that contains a QR code leading to the digital CoA, but this QR code is not on the print itself.

It was developed by Larva Labs and released in June 2017. The pieces were originally free to any Ethereum network user who wanted to mint them. At the time of publication, the lowest-priced CryptoPunks sell for approximately $78,000, and the entire collection has a market capitalization of over $782 million, according to data from CoinGecko. Larva Labs sold the copyrights for CryptoPunks to fellow NFT development team Yuga Labs in March 2022.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-based-virtual-nations-a-new-era-of-governance-and-inclusivity-qa-with-jur-network-and-draper-startup-house",
    "fullContent": "Blockchain-based communities aim to address societal and governance needs, providing better and cheaper services and improving the decision-making process.\nBlockchain-based virtual nations are an emerging concept in the digital realm that seeks to address various societal and governance needs like reduced bureaucracy, better legal systems, cheaper services, democratic decision-making and inclusivity. These virtual nations are decentralized, blockchain-based communities that offer several potential benefits, such as digital sovereignty, transparency, and community-driven governing. In this world increasingly shaped by digital technologies, a Bitcoin-native society Draper Nation, is a new concept poised to redefine traditional notions of governance and societal structures. Underpinned by the Jur Network, a decentralized technical infrastructure, Draper Nation offers a unique model for governance and service delivery. Citizens of Draper Nation have direct ownership and influence over the network and will be able to participate in decision-making processes and activities that actively involve the general public. Vikram Bharati, founder of Draper Startup House, and Alessio Treglia, chief technology officer of the Jur Network, explain in this interview what opportunities Draper Nation offers its citizens and whether such projects can make us a stronger and more engaged citizenry. CT: Vikram, Draper Nation is a revolutionary concept in the crypto space. Could you share the origin story of this Bitcoin-native society and what inspired its creation? Vikram Bharati: Since 2018, we’ve been building physical startup societies around the world through Draper Startup Houses. It dawned on us that by connecting individuals with shared values from different parts of the world, we were creating comprehensive global ecosystems and economies. This realization led us to understand that, in a sense, we were building micronations within other nations. We then realized that there was no reason why we couldn’t create our own virtual nation. All the necessary ingredients were already in place — we just needed to bring them together. 🚀 Introducing Draper Nation: A New Digital Horizon 🌐#DraperNation as envisioned by legendary Silicon Valley investor @TimDraper \u0026 powered by @JurProject, is a borderless, community-driven, and Bitcoin-native #StartupSociety. Let\u0027s dive in to discover more 🧵 pic.twitter.com/xzjTo1L6aI CT: Alessio, for our readers new to the term, could you explain what “Network States” are and how they’re poised to redefine traditional notions of governance and societal structures? Alessio Treglia: Network states are online, decentralized entities that operate very much like states, but they lack control over physical land. They are the successors of the traditional sovereign states. By leveraging Web3 trustless technical tools, network states would allow citizens to interact and trade seamlessly and frictionlessly, causing efficiency to skyrocket and cost to become neglectable. CT: The Jur Network is integral to Draper Nation’s functionality. Could you delve into how it underpins the operations and governance of these emerging Network States? Alessio Treglia: The Jur Network is a decentralized technical infrastructure designed to facilitate on-chain decision-making processes and activities involving the general public in the day-to-day operations of digital communities. Our primary goal is to encourage more people to join these communities and engage directly in public discourse and action. In perspective, while a Facebook user interacts primarily as a consumer within the Facebook network, a Jur Network user has direct ownership and influence over the network. Draper Nation serves as our first real-world, large-scale user community — a critical proving ground where Jur Engineering turns abstract network concepts into practical, real-world applications. CT: Given your extensive experience in blockchain, Alessio, how do you see global trends around decentralization influencing the future of national governance and economies? Alessio Treglia: Global decentralization trends are fundamentally reshaping national governance and economies. In a completely borderless world, centralized control drops its mask and finally appears for what it is — the number one enemy of democracies based on active participation and equality. Peer-to-peer banking and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have given us a glimpse of the future. Now, we can empower individuals by ensuring financial inclusion and democratizing access to resources and opportunities. Governance models will gradually shift to decentralized models that allow citizens to participate in decision-making and policy formulation in a transparent and equitable manner. CT: Vikram, Draper Nation emphasizes community, especially through its NFT passport initiative. How do you envision this fostering a stronger, more engaged citizenry? Vikram Bharati: Draper Nation will eventually offer numerous services typically provided by governments. Since everything will be virtual and without intermediaries, we will be able to deliver these services at a fraction of the cost. The NFT passport will serve as the citizen-owned digital ID, granting the citizens access to all products and services.  CT: Startup cities are a fascinating aspect of Draper Nation. Could you explain how these special economic zones (SEZs) operate and the benefits they offer to residents, both virtual and physical? Vikram Bharati: We are passionate about a new concept of Startup Cities. Think of them as neighborhoods tailored to the needs and dreams of everyone who lives there. They’re not just places to live, they’re hubs filled with exciting perks and services. What excites me is our effort to seamlessly weave in Web3 capabilities. So imagine handling things like Visa applications, setting up your business, managing insurance, and even paying taxes, all integrated and simplified. We’re trying to eliminate unnecessary middlemen and make everything more direct and efficient. But what will set our cities apart? It’s the spirit of innovation and collaboration. Living there means you’re not just a neighbor: you’re an integral part of its history, its growth. So imagine living in a place where you’re not just a resident but an invested stakeholder, celebrating every milestone of your own Startup City. CT: Looking ahead, what major milestones can we expect from Draper Nation and the Jur Network in the upcoming year? Vikram Bharati: The first year of Draper Nation will be experimental as we seek to understand who truly wants to be a part of this new nation and what the citizens’ aspirations are for its future. In essence, we want to co-create this nation with the help of its citizens. We will co-write the Manifesto and then the Constitution of Draper Nation through community-driven activities. We have already held two inaugural events and have more to come with the opening of a new embassy in Hyderabad. Netizens will have access to benefits of various kinds: free accommodations for events, scholarships, and more. CT: How do you both see the evolution of crypto and blockchain technologies impacting global governance models in the long term? Is there potential for a “Democracy 2.0”? Alessio Treglia: We’re on the cusp of what some call “Democracy 2.0”, and it’s not just a technological shift. It’s an exciting socio-political evolution. Imagine a world where bureaucratic hurdles are a thing of the past, where citizens can participate directly, and where every voice truly matters in shaping governance. This transformation promises to unleash an unprecedented wave of democratic energy and inclusiveness. CT: Are there any upcoming yet-to-be-announced developments that you’d like to share exclusively with our readers today? Alessio Treglia: The Jur Network is in the process of transitioning to proof-of-stake (PoS) and will soon enable JUR staking. We will soon enable the creation of new tokens and economies for Jur-based societies. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/neon-machine-raises-20-m-series-a-web-3-blockchain-based-call-of-duty-competitor-shrapnel",
    "fullContent": "The company claims a cast of employees whose collective entertainment industry resume contains titles such as Halo, Call of Duty and Westworld.\nWeb3 gaming developer Neon Machine raised $20 million in Series A funding toward the development of its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Shrapnel. This round follows a $10.5 million seed round completed in June of 2021. It was led by Polychain Capital and included funding from Griffin Gaming Partners, Brevan Howard Digital, Franklin Templeton, IOSG Ventures and Tess Ventures. Shrapnel is an ambitious gaming project touted by Neon Machine as a AAA game — an expression for video games with top-tier production value, budgeting and marketing. According to gameplay footage shown on Neon Machine’s YouTube page and documentation on the game’s website, Shrapnel is a first-person shooter featuring multiplayer components. Competition in the game — which currently has yet to enter pre-alpha testing — will purportedly come in the form of “extraction” mechanics requiring the player to escape with any loot they find in-game in order to retain those items. Early gameplay videos show what appears to be a gameplay loop consistent with Call of Duty: Warzone, a popular free-to-play extraction shooter developed by Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard studio. What separates Shrapnel from similar AAA competition is its reliance on Web3 and blockchain. While other games, such as The Division 2, have mechanics in place where players can “extract” valuable items in order to apply them to their character and profiles, the assets in Shrapnel are connected to the blockchain. According to the studio, this allows the players full ownership over the assets. Related: Shrapnel Web3 shooter won’t let US users cash out, thanks to Gensler Shrapnel will also feature a modding toolset that, theoretically, could allow players or developers to insert other blockchain assets into the game world for players to interact with. This could, hypothetically, create an intriguing scenario for both seasonal competition and tournament play. The game is slated for early-access testing for paid subscribers in December, according to a press release from Neon Machine. Once the initial evaluation period ends, the company intends to launch the game as a free-to-play title “sometime” in 2024. Beyond the development and launch of Shrapnel, Neon Machine has also said that it intends to eventually license its Web3 developer’s API platform, GameBridge, after the launch.",

Keep reading to stay up-to-date with the latest stories on nonfungible tokens. Every Wednesday, the Nifty Newsletter informs and inspires you to dig deeper into the latest NFT trends and insights. In this week’s newsletter, read about how a nonfungible token (NFT) became a focus point in a Singapore court battle, learn about the importance of decentralized randomness in the Web3 gaming sector and find out why Universal Music Group is suing Anthropic over copyright infringement. The Singapore High Court has allowed financial investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary to attach NFTs containing a legal document to cold wallets associated with a hack, according to United Kingdom-based iSanctuary and local press accounts. A court-issued worldwide freeze order was tokenized as soulbound NFTs and attached to the wallets in question. The NFTs will not prevent transactions with the wallets but will serve as a warning to counterparties and exchanges that the wallets were involved in a hack. In addition, iSanctuary claimed it had devised a means of tracking funds leaving the wallets, thanks to the NFTs. The NFTs will be permanently attached to the wallets. Continue reading Random numbers are of great importance in a number of applications, including games, security systems, decentralized autonomous organization governance and NFT generation. If your game cannot access randomly generated numbers, your starts will become repetitive and stale. If your security system relies on easily guessed authentication codes, it isn’t providing much security. If any system that needs variety isn’t getting it, it won’t be very effective. For many applications, this is effective. True randomness is not required in every application. In a video game with random encounters, for example, there may only be a limited number of actions the game can take at any given time. A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that provides values outside a given scope isn’t going to be of much use. When the stakes are low, technical requirements often match. However, the quality of a PRNG can vary dramatically. This can be an issue for applications with higher stakes, with many people depending on them or in various use cases.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/revolutionizing-whitelist-marketplace-for-web3-whitelist-zone-partners-with-cointelegraph-accelerator",
    "fullContent": "The whitelist marketplace WhiteList Zone onboarded over 50 projects that collectively submitted more than 8,000 whitelists.\nIn the Web3 space, one of the key challenges for new projects and products is to get a motivated audience and for crypto-enthusiasts and investors — to find the most promising projects and get in earlier than others. This is where whitelists step in, addressing several critical aspects. A whitelist is a curated list of addresses or users with authorized access to specific privileges. It grants entry to activities like presales, token sales, initial coin offerings (ICOs), nonfungible token (NFT) minting, or access to various events. It works as an exclusive guest list, allowing only approved participants to join the party while keeping others out. For crypto-enthusiasts and investors, whitelists represent an early-access opportunity to secure a position ahead of the crowd, enabling them to purchase assets or participate in events before the general public. Being on a whitelist often grants lower entry prices, additional token allocations or lower gas fees, enhancing the investment potential. A prominent example is the Bored Ape Yacht Club participants who received free NFTs that later had a market value significantly higher than their original price. For projects, whitelists serve as a strategic tool to onboard the most motivated users, encouraging them to engage in activities like social media promotion and friend referrals to earn a coveted spot on the whitelist. Moreover, whitelists ensure a fair and equitable distribution of tokens or resources, reducing the risk of concentrated ownership. They also serve as a regulatory safeguard by implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which verify participants\u0027 identities. In essence, whitelists act as a robust security measure, shielding projects from potential scams or malicious actors by thoroughly vetting participants in advance, ensuring that only legitimate individuals or entities can participate in their events or projects. However, getting on the whitelist is a complex and risky endeavor. Users often need to register their wallets on the project\u0027s website as part of the onboarding process and compete with thousands of other crypto-enthusiasts for a small amount of available spots. Additionally, they must demonstrate their eligibility by completing various laborious tasks, including generating user-generated content, social media support (likes, shares, subscriptions), securing referrals, and undertaking actions that enhance the project\u0027s brand awareness. For those unable to secure a whitelist spot legitimately, a black and gray market offers an alternative, but it’s often fraught with risks. Transactions in this realm take place in less regulated and secure environments, such as over-the-counter (OTC) groups on Telegram or Discord, leaving participants vulnerable to fraudulent schemes and malicious actors who can take advantage of their trust and desire for whitelist access. In response to these challenges, a groundbreaking solution has emerged — WhiteList Zone. Launched in alpha in June 2023, WhiteList Zone has quickly established itself as a marketplace where crypto enthusiasts can directly purchase whitelists from launchpads, project owners and whitelist winners. These whitelists serve as golden tickets, granting investors the right to participate in initial decentralized offerings (IDOs), NFT mintings and other events hosted by crypto projects. Investors can say goodbye to the gray markets and uncertain terrain of Telegram and Discord channels, as WhiteList Zone now provides safe and easy access to whitelists. To buy whitelist spots, investors simply need to visit the marketplace, browse the list of available projects, select their preferred one and complete the transaction in less than a minute.  Users can discover new projects based on category, network, or sale type. Source: WhiteList Zone WhiteList Zone believes in direct collaboration with launchpads and projects to ensure that scams and fraud are a thing of the past. By establishing these partnerships, the platform creates a reliable ecosystem right from the start. This means that when users access whitelist opportunities on WhiteList Zone, they can trust that they are engaging in legitimate transactions. What’s more, WhiteList Zone offers an easy-to-use interface and a simple onboarding experience and continues to expand its support, currently accommodating over 140 cryptocurrencies, with plans to introduce convenient credit card payment options soon. When it comes to projects looking to issue whitelists, WhiteList Zone also emerges as the top choice, as the marketplace boosts engagement among whitelist winners. This proactive and engaged community is a valuable asset for projects seeking active participation and support. Moreover, the platform generates valuable data that empowers projects to make informed decisions. This data-driven approach aids in strategizing and optimizing whitelist distribution, resulting in more effective outcomes. WhiteList Zone recently became the latest participant of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program. The Accelerator has picked WhiteList Zone due to the latter’s potential to disrupt the whitelist market. With a team of 15 people, the Ukraine-based project has shown good traction since launching the alpha version in June 2023. The marketplace has successfully attracted users from 71 countries and onboarded over 50 projects that have collectively contributed more than 8,000 whitelists. Furthermore, WhiteList Zone has plans to launch its token generation event in the second quarter of 2024.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/gaming-immutable-guild-of-guardians-blockchain",
    "fullContent": "Guild of Guardians is a dungeon-crawling mobile adventure game with a play-to-earn twist.\nFrom Oct. 9–20, Immutable invited playtesters to try out an early demo of its upcoming mobile game, Guild of Guardians. Guild of Guardians was first announced in 2021. Its utility token, Guild of Guardians Gems (GOG), went up for sale in December 2021, raising over $5.3 million for the game’s development. In addition, over 800,000 individuals registered for the token sale, which Immutable claimed was an “oversubscription” of 82 times vs. the expected demand. It is being developed by Mineloader, which is the same company that created the Final Fantasy VII remake and Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Gods Unchained creator Immutable is publishing the game. According to the game’s roadmap, it is expected to be released in open beta sometime in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Guild of Guardians documents state that it will be a free-to-play and play-to-earn mobile game. Players will not need to make any purchases to begin playing the game and start earning nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or game tokens. To finance the game’s further development after launch, Immutable will sell “seasonal content” consisting of limited edition NFTs, including “heroes, pets, guilds and energy boosters.” They will also charge a percentage fee on secondary sales of some of the game’s items. The play-to-earn aspect of Guild of Guardians will revolve around crafting equipment and summoning heroes. Players will be able to earn crafting materials as they progress through dungeons, which they’ll be able to use to mint NFTs that represent gear. They’ll also be able to collect “common” heroes that can be combined into higher rarities and minted on the blockchain. Guild of Guardians NFTs are minted on the Immutable X network, while the GOG token is on Ethereum. Ever since the fundraise, details about the state of the game’s development have been scarce. But Immutable invited members of the media to playtest the game From Oct. 9 to 20, and this writer was one of the persons invited. Guild of Guardians is designed entirely for mobile. You can play it on a mobile phone or tablet, and it’s available for both iOS and Android. But there’s no way currently to play it on a PC or console, and the team doesn’t appear to be planning to make a PC version anytime soon, if ever. The controls of the game are optimized for mobile gameplay, as the battles are mostly automated, with very little real-time control during fights. Related: What is Gods Unchained, and how to play it. In the Guild of Guardians docs, the team emphasized that mobile games are more accessible than any other type of video game. The number of people in the world who own smartphones is much greater than the number who own PCs, which is why they chose to make Guild of Guardians strictly a mobile game with touch-screen controls. Guild of Guardians is a classic “dungeon-crawl” game. The main gameplay consists of progressing through various dungeons, fighting monsters and opening treasure chests for loot. Players can choose which dungeon to explore by clicking on it from within an in-game world map. Once a dungeon is chosen, the player’s party of heroes loads into the first room, which usually contains monsters that can be fought. After each room is cleared, the player can choose which room to go to next. Different rooms contain different enemy strengths and rewards, and the player is presented with these metrics when making the decision. Some rooms contain treasure chests, healing or other boosts that may help the party to progress. Once a player progresses through all of the choices and defeats all the monsters, the dungeon ends. In this case, the main menu pops back up, and the heroes who died in the dungeon are resurrected. If all party members die before the dungeon is completed, the player fails the dungeon. However, they still get to keep the items they acquired from their partial completion. New dungeons become unlocked as old ones are completed. If the player completes all of the dungeons, they unlock a new “infinite” mode. This mode apparently allows a player to play through never-ending randomly generated dungeons for even more loot. I unfortunately didn’t make it far enough to test out infinite mode. The game has mostly automated battles. To start a battle, the player clicks on a “fight” button and watches the fight play out. They can choose to activate characters’ ultimate abilities manually, in which case there is some interaction during battles. However, they can also choose to have these abilities activated automatically, making the battles a completely passive experience. The challenge to winning a battle comes from decisions made before it begins. Before entering a dungeon, the player chooses which heroes to put into a party. Each hero has different abilities. Some are tanks or healers, while others are focused on damage-dealing. To succeed, the player needs to create a party out of characters whose abilities complement each other. In addition, characters can be placed in various positions within the party’s formation before a battle begins. Tanks should go in the front, while ranged damage dealers and healers should be placed in the back. Players also influence their ability to win by deciding which gear to outfit their characters with. I found that the battles were pretty balanced in terms of difficulty. My party cleaved its way through lots of small trash packs with ease, while there were a few bosses that slaughtered them without mercy. I was happy to see that heroes are automatically resurrected after a dungeon failure. Two of the most important goals in Guild of Guardians are to collect heroes and craft equipment. To get a new hero, the player must obtain a “summon,” which allows them to roll for a randomly selected hero. There seems to be a wide variety of heroes that can be collected, each with different artwork, ultimate abilities and stats. Some of the “summons” can be obtained as rewards for exploring dungeons, while a certain number are also given out as login rewards. Players get two heroes in the tutorial: one tank and one healer. I found that the hero-collecting system was a pretty satisfying reward mechanic. The heroes had a lot of variety in terms of stats and abilities, which made getting a new hero feel significant. To craft gear, the player needs to collect crafting materials within dungeons. I crafted a single item throughout my playtest sessions but couldn’t gain more experience than that. The game’s documents state that gear items differ in terms of rarity, with more rare items requiring more rare materials to craft. Different pieces of crafted gear provide different unique buffs; some items are parts of sets that give bigger bonuses if a character wears more than one piece from the set, the documents stated. Related: Game review: Axie Infinity currently rules the Pay-to-Win-to-Earn roost The Guild of Guardians demo that I played was an early version of the game. The public release will likely have more features and content. But so far, the game’s development seems to be on the right track. The battles are challenging, and there are a variety of strategic decisions the player has to make in order to succeed. This is not a run-of-the-mill play-to-earn game featuring mindless grinding for cryptocurrency. The gameplay is engaging and requires significant thought from the player. Fans of turn-based RPGs may enjoy Guild of Guardians, as it scratches their itch for strategic challenges. On the other hand, players who are looking for Diablo-style real-time action may want to pass over Guild of Guardians when it’s released. The battles in the game are almost entirely automated, so there’s no test of reflexes in this particular dungeon-crawler.

    "fullContent": "This project brings 250 years of expertise in gold to the blockchain to provide a stable entry into the crypto market.\nAs people look for a stable way to enter into the crypto market, this gold-backed digital ecosystem with a crypto token and NFTs offers a solution. Gold, a precious metal known for its scarcity and durability, has been the primary store of value since ancient civilizations. For thousands of years, people prized gold in their trades and investments. Even in the modern world, gold reserves are a major indicator of how strong and reliable a country’s economy is. Despite the gold standard being largely abandoned in 1971, governments and central banks worldwide still hold thousands of tonnes of gold in their reserves as a backup, showing that old habits die hard. In the era of cryptocurrency, a digital form of gold has emerged. Blockchain technology has enabled the proving and tracing of digital ownership of any asset transparently, paving the way for gold reserves to be digitized and represented by gold-backed tokens. Just like how stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, gold-backed tokens are also pegged to the real-time price of gold. Offering stability for users who want to hedge against both inflation and the volatility of the crypto market, gold-backed crypto tokens also simplify and democratize investments in gold by making it globally accessible. The potential of gold-backed crypto tokens accelerates traditional gold companies’ jump into Web3. International Precious Metals (IPM), a team of precious metals specialists with over 250 years of combined industry experience, announced that they are bringing their gold expertise to the crypto market with the launch of the gold-backed International Precious Metals Bullion (IPMB) coin and the accompanying Globally exchanged Metal (GeM) nonfungible token (NFT). Operating under environmental, social and governance (ESG) compliance, IPM has built a process traceable from the mining of gold to the minting of gold-backed tokens on the blockchain, resulting in a vertically-integrated coin. IPMB represents 1 gram of physical gold. Each IPMB is backed by unallocated investment-grade gold held in listed recognized vaults, including Brinks or Sharps Pixley. IPMB vaulted stocks are audited by Grant Thornton, one of the largest audit, tax and advisory firms.  The IPMB utility token allows holders to benefit from the stability of physical gold without the need to store and secure physical gold bars. IPMB holders have direct access to the underlying asset with the security of 100% physical gold backing while eliminating the management costs and counterparty risks associated with gold-based traditional finance products. Users can store IPMB tokens on supported crypto wallets, with trading starting on the Changelly crypto exchange on Oct. 30. GeM NFT is a key pillar of the IPMB ecosystem that is backed by — and exchangeable into — traceable, sustainably produced pure gold bars. Each GeM token comes in varying sizes, representing different amounts of gold. Users who hold IPMB for a year are qualified for a 12% discount on switching to the GeM NFTs, which can be redeemed for physical gold. Highlighting the potential of the IPMB ecosystem as a safe, secure and trusted resource backed by gold, John Vakis, founder and CEO of IPM, said: “We are providing a community-based ecosystem where owners can have liquidity, save and earn on their holdings. The IPMB achieves this with full ESG compliance, product certification and international quality standards.” As the crypto market looks for stability to attract more users, gold-backed tokens hold immense potential to onboard users who have concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. With a secure and trusted ecosystem based on gold, IPM aims to utilize blockchain technology to build a bridge between the stability of traditional gold and the flexibility of digital tokens.

    "fullContent": "Uniswap announced it would start charging a swap fee of 15% from Oct. 17, evoking mixed reactions from the crypto community.\nWelcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week. The past week in DeFi was dominated by developments in the popular decentralized exchange platform Uniswap after it announced a 0.15% swap fee starting on Oct. 17, and an open-source hook on Uniswap generated controversy due to Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. In other major DeFi developments, Platypus Finance managed to recover 90% of the funds it lost to an Oct. 12 exploit while the layer-2 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) “Scroll” launched its mainnet. The top 100 DeFi tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week thanks to Friday momentum in the market, with a majority of the tokens trading in green and recording double-digit gains on the weekly charts. However, the price action didn’t reflect on the total value locked (TVL), which fell by nearly $2 billion. The Ethereum liquid staking derivatives finance (LSDFi) ecosystem has seen a surge in growth this year as Ether (ETH) holders chose to stake rather than liquidate. Despite ETH withdrawals being enabled with the Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April 2023, an Oct. 16 LSDFi report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko said the sector has grown by 58.7x since January. By August 2023, LSD protocols accounted for 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH staked, with Lido having the lion’s share at almost a third of the total staked market. Continue reading Scroll, a new contender in the zkEVM space that works to scale the blockchain, has confirmed the launch of its mainnet. The team behind Scroll announced the launch in an Oct. 17 post and added that existing applications and developer tool kits on Ethereum can now migrate to the new scaling solution. “Everything functions right out of the box,” the Scroll team said. Continue reading DeFi protocol Platypus Finance said it had recovered 90% of assets stolen in a security breach last week. According to the Oct. 17 announcement, the protocol’s net loss was limited to 18,000 Avalanche (AVAX) worth $167,400 at the time. As the hacker voluntarily returned the funds, Platypus Finance stated it “will guarantee that no legal action will be pursued.” It also hinted that withdrawal information regarding users’ assets will soon be posted. Continue reading Decentralized exchange Uniswap began charging a 0.15% swap fee on certain tokens in its web application and wallet on Oct. 17. According to a post by Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, the affected tokens are ETH, USD Coin (USDC), Wrapped Ether (wETH), Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Angle Protocol’s agEUR, Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Euro Coin (EUROC) and StraitsX Singapore Dollar (XSGD). Shortly after publication, a spokesperson for Uniswap reached out to Cointelegraph, stating that “both the input and output token need to be on the list for the fee to apply.” Continue reading A new hook available on an open-source directory for Uniswap v4 hooks is sparking controversy within the crypto community. The hook enables users to be checked for KYC before they can trade in token pools. Criticizing the hook, a user on X (formerly Twitter) noted that the hook opens up the possibility of decentralized finance protocols being whitelisted by regulators. Continue reading Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that DeFi’s top 100 tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week, with most tokens trading in the green on weekly charts. However, the total value locked into DeFi protocols dropped to $43.81 billion. Thanks for reading our summary of this week’s most impactful DeFi developments.

Check out a Web3 executive’s thoughts on how the NFT market slump is actually a sign of maturity, and in other news, learn more about an incident in which MetaMask was briefly removed from Apple’s App Store. A bipartisan parliamentary committee recently urged officials in the United Kingdom to take action to protect creators from the possibilities of copyright violations stemming from NFTs. The committee also asked the government to address the potential harms of sporting groups issuing digital assets. According to the committee members, the “most pressing issue” is the risk to the intellectual property rights of artists due to the ease and speed at which NFTs can be minted. Continue reading The executive director of the Decentraland Foundation, Yemel Jardis, told Cointelegraph he believes that with more community education on NFTs, the focus will shift from speculative trading to genuine utility. According to the executive, a steep collapse in the price of NFTs shouldn’t be seen as a sign of distress. Jardi said the NFT market has not “regressed” — rather, “it’s maturing.” Continue reading The Ethereum wallet MetaMask, popular among NFT collectors, was removed from Apple’s App Store for several hours on Oct. 14. This raised concerns over a complete removal from the marketplace. At the time, Apple users were also unable to download the application from the MetaMask website.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-play-to-earn-game-offers-nfts-linked-to-physical-items-like-gold",
    "fullContent": "The days of wasting hundreds of hours on a game and receiving almost nothing in return are over — and it\u0027s all thanks to NFTs and blockchain technology.\nBlockchain gaming is going from strength to strength — underpinned by the explosion of nonfungible tokens, which continue to achieve mainstream adoption. The FRUITS Eco-Blockchain Project is building on this momentum by allowing NFTs to be redeemed for a coveted, real-world object: a physical golden egg. First came the console, then the humble PC. Smartphones soon came along and transformed the entertainment industry entirely — making games free to play, and putting them in the hands of consumers in emerging economies. Now, blockchain technology and nonfungible tokens (NFT) are ushering in the next wave of innovation. Once, in-game assets couldn\u0027t be transported from one title to another, traded freely with others, and sold on secondary markets. Web3 makes this possible — all while allowing avid players to receive recognition and rewards in exchange for their time. The days of wasting hundreds of hours on a game and getting almost nothing in return are coming to an end. Of course, some hurdles need to be overcome first. A 2022 report released by the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) showed that industry professionals found poor gameplay and complex onboarding as the main challenges that hinder mass adoption. Gamers deserve an easy-to-use interface with fun storylines and interesting avatars. The experience also needs to be beyond monetization — ensuring there\u0027s much more on offer than NFTs. That\u0027s where the FRUITS Eco-Blockchain Project comes in. It has launched a new title that aims to take play-to-earn gaming to the next level by allowing users to win free gold eggs by getting involved. Golden Egg Wonderland starts off with the story of a painter called Turtlen, who created vibrant artwork of birds and dreamed of one that could lay a golden egg. Suddenly, one of his drawings came to life. In this game, users have the chance to raise their own \"turtori\" — and make a collection that can crossbreed with one another. The higher rarity and status Turtori have a higher chance to lay golden egg NFTs, and in a novel development, gamers can redeem this for a real-world equivalent. Each character has been illustrated by an artist called Kamerian. — an up-and-coming star. To start playing the game, players should set up a FRUITS Wallet. Aside from giving them access to gameplay, the FRUITS Wallet also allows players to purchase FRTS Coins. These coins can be exchanged for blue diamonds which boost gamers’ chances of getting higher rarity birds. The higher the rarity and status of the birds, the higher the chance that they lay a golden egg, and the higher the chance it’s bigger. All of this comes as interest in gold continues to grow following high levels of inflation around the world — eroding the earnings of everyday consumers.  Golden Egg Wonderland’s developers believe that if their project is successful, it has the potential to usher in the wave of a new gold market. Gold is notoriously difficult to carry and transport, but NFTs backed by this precious metal can be owned, bought, sold, exchanged and redeemed in a digital setting. Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to be used to determine how many golden eggs will be issued in the game every month, based on the amount of gold that\u0027s been generated in the real world. Every coveted Golden Egg NFT will also be assigned a unique serial number for maximum transparency and security. This adds a fascinating economic element to the game and opens the door to blurring the lines between the game and the real world — all connected through the blockchain. The team behind Golden Egg Wonderland is hoping to make a splash on the world stage — opening a booth at Tokyo\u0027s Blockchain Expo on October 25. And in time, the project plans to collaborate with a plethora of famous fighters, athletes, artists and musicians to champion the \"turtori\" project. Disclaimer.

    "fullContent": "Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, has completed restructuring to focus on its upcoming metaverse project, Otherside.\nYuga Labs, the company behind the major nonfungible token (NFT) project Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has completed restructuring amid the ongoing challenges in the industry. Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre took to X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 17 to report that the company has finalized its restructuring, which was announced in early October. “We now begin the task of refining the focus with our new team configurations,” Alegre said, reiterating that the company will prioritize the execution of Otherside, a gamified and interoperable metaverse project that Yuga started in March 2022. Alegre emphasized that building an “immersive metaverse” platform is hard both technically and creatively, adding: Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano previously announced the company’s restructuring on Oct. 6, stating that Yuga “needed to make some changes” in order to ensure that it’s set up for long-term success. “With this reorg, Yuga is still over 120 employees, and is focused on specific priorities,” Solano said. He didn’t specify how many people had to leave Yuga Labs as part of the restructuring. Alegre also assured that his top priority during restructuring was to “ensure that those leaving Yuga are treated with the respect and gratitude they deserve.” He claimed that Yuga’s transition package included “generous severance,” the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act coverage and assistance in finding new job opportunities. The CEO added: Yuga Labs did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Related: Microsoft’s Activision buy may see more metaverse in the office and crypto in gaming The news comes amid a U.S. appeals court on Oct. 16 expressing skepticism about an attempt to dismiss Yuga Labs’ trademark lawsuit against artist Ryder Ripps over his copies of Yuga’s BAYC NFTs. Previously, a group of BAYC investors filed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs and fine arts auction house Sotheby’s in August 2023, alleging that the auction house helped Yuga Labs “deceptively promote” the NFT collection.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/gamers-can-now-explore-mars-in-tesla-inspired-cybertrucks-heres-how",
    "fullContent": "The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, was once a landscape only scientists could examine. But now, a topographically accurate game opens the red planet up to the masses.\nThe Web3 game Mars4, which allows players to explore the surface of Mars, has unveiled two new exclusive rovers inspired by Tesla\u0027s Cybertrucks. For decades, space enthusiasts have had a fascination with Mars. NASA\u0027s Perseverance rover is giving us regular insight on what life is like some 140 million miles away — with footage recently capturing a rare weather phenomenon known as a dust devil. There are so many unanswered questions. Has life ever existed on this planet? Were there once friendly conditions where species could thrive? What are the hurdles that stand in the way of human and robotic exploration? In the past, understanding Mars has been an opportunity only reserved for scientists. But huge technological transformations — such as virtual reality (VR) — now offer ordinary people the chance to get up close and personal to an environment so divorced from our own. NASA data has paved the way for detailed 3D maps of the terrain on Mars to be created. Now, all of this topography has been transformed into a game where everyone can play and interact in an accurate Martian landscape where they must battle to survive.  Mars4 is an AAA 3D game that\u0027s been built using the Unreal Engine 5.1, a game engine made by Epic Games. Players have the chance to own a piece of land on the red planet, with each offering a distinctive environment. According to this play-to-earn game, more than 60,000 plots have already been sold. From here, the goal of the title is simple: explore, expand your land, construct dream buildings, gather resources, establish a colony, and create value. While it may be an unforgiving and harsh atmosphere, establishing a fully-fledged habitat creates a better chance of survival — and any resources found can be traded with fellow explorers. New features are continually being added — with two rovers inspired by Tesla Cybertrucks, Phobos X and Deimos X, recently introduced. Both are only available for a limited time only and are low in quantity, meaning there\u0027s likely to be fierce competition for these in-game assets. According to Mars4, this is a fitting tribute given how the project was inspired by the electric vehicle manufacturer.  And that\u0027s not all. A robotic pet called Bullionaire has also been launched — giving colonists a helping hand and additional inventory space. Meanwhile, a new decoration set allows players to add a few homely touches to their properties. Whereas other games suffer from limited levels, a lack of land to explore and unrelatable storylines, Mars4 says it has something for everyone. Now, intrepid adventurers can build a new world from the ground up, go where no player has gone before, and be the first to make exciting discoveries about the surface of the red planet. Beyond its entertainment value, this title has the potential to be truly educational — a game that parents wouldn\u0027t mind their kids spending hours on. Mars4 is continually looking to break new ground and add further enhancements — over the summer, players could take to the skies in jetpacks, with an Alpha 1 sandbox released to test multiplayer functionality. All this, when coupled with regular ask-me-anything sessions and AI-generated art competitions that shed Mars in a new light, serve as the building blocks for forming a vibrant, outward-looking new community.

The staff note described DeFi as a multi-layered structure, with the Ethereum blockchain serving as the bottom layer (or settlement layer). Developers construct a variety of tools and services on top of the main blockchain, including tokenization, lending and borrowing services, and much more. The staff note shed light on the rise in popularity of the DeFi ecosystem starting in 2020 and how it became an integral part of the crypto economy, with billions in volume over the next few years. The popularity of the ecosystem took a dip starting in 2022 with the collapse of multiple key crypto platforms with significant DeFi exposure, including Terra. Talking about the key features of the decentralized ecosystem, the staff note lauded DeFi’s “composability,” which allows the apps and services in the ecosystem to interconnect. The Bank of Canada note highlighted three of the key areas where DeFi can transform the financial system: Apart from the key DeFi innovations that can transform the traditional financial system, the staff note also talked about the challenges and risks associated with the DeFi ecosystem, claiming that “despite its innovations and possibilities, the overall economic benefits of DeFi remain limited.” Related: Bank of Canada emphasizes need for stablecoin regulation as legislation is tabled The note lists three key challenges that the DeFi system faces today: the lack of real-world tokenization, the higher concentration of interconnection within, and its dependence on the unregulated centralized finance ecosystem. The note also highlighted the regulatory challenges posed by the DeFi ecosystem and the rise in vulnerabilities in the ecosystem, leading to several hacks and exploits.

    "fullContent": "The lawyer representing Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen struggled to convince a panel of judges that Yuga Labs’ case against his clients should be thrown out under California’s anti-SLAPP statute.\nNonfungible token (NFT) artist Ryder Ripps’ most recent attempt to dismiss the Bored Ape Yacht Club-related lawsuit against him appears to have fallen on skeptical ears. In an Oct. 16 hearing, three judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth District appeared largely unpersuaded by the arguments from the attorney representing Ripps and Jeremy Cahen (known by the pseudonym “Pauly” on X), who argued the case should have been dismissed on the grounds of free speech. Ripps and Cahen’s lawyer, WilmerHale partner Thomas Sprankling, argued the knock-off Bored Ape NFTs were sold and distributed in a way that protested the supposedly anti-semitic imagery hidden within the Yuga Labs-created collection. He repeatedly positioned Ripps and Cahen as selling the NFTs as an avant-garde exercise that pushes the boundaries of speech and claimed Yuga’s suit should have been thrown out under a California law that aims to stop intimidatory lawsuits, known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP. Sprankling told the judges that the anti-SLAPP statute is designed as a “prophylactic” — meaning that it is supposed to go “a little beyond the bounds of the First Amendment to make sure you’re not threatening people with chilling speech in litigation, as is the case that happened here.” In their anti-SLAPP motion, the pair asserted that Yuga Labs only initiated the lawsuit against them to silence their “protest” art and drown them in legal costs. However, the judges seemed interested only in the secondary sales of the NFTs themselves, essentially dismissing all arguments that hinged on any artistic criticism. “He was selling the same images, on the same marketplaces, on virtually indistinguishable NFT identifiers,” said Judge Anthony Johnstone in response to Sprankling’s argument. “I’m still not seeing it,” added Judge Morgan Christen. Related: NFT market slump shows it’s maturing toward ‘genuine utility,’ execs argue Yuga Labs first filed a complaint against Ripps and Cahen in July 2022, alleging the pair made millions of dollars while engaging in trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition following the release of a derivative NFT collection called RR/BAYC. On April 21, a California District Court found that Ripps and Cahen had infringed Yuga Lab’s trademarks with their RR/BAYC NFT collection. While Californian District Court Judge John Walter has already held a bench trial to assess the scope of damages to be paid to Yuga Labs, he has yet to announce the case’s conclusion.

    "fullContent": "Decentraland Foundation executive director Yemel Jardis believes as people become more educated about NFTs, the focus will shift from speculative trading to genuine utility.\nA steep collapse in the price of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) shouldn’t be seen as a sign of distress but rather a signal the technology is maturing, according to Web3 executives. “I wouldn’t say the NFT market has regressed,“ Decentraland Foundation executive director Yemel Jardi told Cointelegraph. “Rather, it’s maturing.\" Jardi’s comments come after a September report from dappGambl that analyzed over 73,000 NFT collections and concluded that as much as 95% of the NFTs studied had no value, as prices, sales volume and transactions have slid over the past year. Jardi stressed that markets are cyclic and it is natural for there to be periods of adjustment. He attributed sliding NFT floor prices partly to “speculative trading” and said the value of NFTs should instead be anchored to their utility. Anjali Young, co-founder of the tokenized community-management platform Collab.Land, isn’t surprised about the anti-NFT sentiment either. “Any innovation — especially this one with financial impact, cultural value and status — will attract questioning during its downs,” she said. Young believes many projects have stumbled since marketplaces such as OpenSea removed mandated royalty fees in late August. Despite this, Young claimed that NFTs are “here to stay” and expects they will be more frequently used for loyalty programs, rewards, advertising and proof of authenticity in the coming months. They\u0027ve left us all for dead, saying 95% of NFTs are worthless. But the truth is very, very different. Look no further than car companies and their adoption of NFT tech ️ From collectibles to supply chains, perhaps no industry is more bullish on Web3. A short thread Tama Churchouse, chief operating officer of Cumberland Labs, recently opined that NFTs aren’t “dead,” arguing that recent developments in the space show there are still signs of life. While the NFT market has primarily been dominated by digital art, Jardi said that nonfungible tokens remain an important tool for the broader digital landscape, as ownership of tangible assets can be denoted to users in novel ways. Wow, someone just listed a $26.5 million building in one of New York City\u0027s most prestigious areas as an #nft. Handling property rights through NFTs is a very exciting use case to cut out the middle men. #realestate #nfts #NFTCommunity #nftcollector pic.twitter.com/PowOwwMZsb Jardi believes governments and institutions will leverage NFTs in the future for various use cases. On Oct. 9, the Chinese-state-owned newspaper China Daily announced plans to launch a platform for trading digital collectibles. Related: Mainstream NFT adoption will be driven mostly by their utility The entertainment sector is another huge market for the NFT industry to capture, according to Scott Lawin, CEO of sports token platform Candy Digital. Lawin told Cointelegraph that 24% of Major League Baseball fans who entered stadiums with mobile tickets in 2022 redeemed their complimentary commemorative digital ticket provided by Candy as a form of memorabilia. “Those are all utilities of NFTs in real time,” Lawin added. On the brand side, Adidas, Bud Light, Gucci, Prada and other companies dipping into the NFT space have seen a recent uptick in the number of active users on their Discord channels, Young said. The NFT market capitalization currently stands at $5 billion, according to data from Forbes Digital Assets. The Yuga Labs-owned CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club collections are the two largest, with market caps of $710 million and $400 million, respectively.

    "fullContent": "The market for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) might be struggling during this \"NFT Winter,\" but there are signs of life if you know where to look.\nHeadlines predicting the death of Bitcoin are nothing new. Over the past decade, we’ve seen every permutation of why “Bitcoin is dead” imaginable, yet the current crypto winter has brought very few of these dire proclamations. It seems a little different this time. Maybe it’s hard to pen such a eulogy with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $28,000, and a spot Bitcoin ETF on the horizon. Doesn’t seem like Ethereum’s dead either. But the blockchain industry and its commentators still need a corpse to poke at, and that’s what they’ve found with the putrid cadaver that is the nonfungible token (NFT) market. Related: The economy is surging — which means it might be time to start buying Bitcoin NFTs are dead. Deceased. Lifeless. NFTs are the “Norwegian Blue” from Monty Python’s Dead Parrot Sketch. And the grave dancing has commenced; to quote a recent Rolling Stone headline, “Your NFTs are actually — finally — totally worthless.” Rolling Stone is right — most NFTs are indeed utterly worthless. Yet that should not be surprising to anyone who’s been in crypto for a few cycles. Most of the ICO tokens from the 2017 bull market vintage were dead by the 2018/19 winter. Likewise, the countless DeFi protocol tokens post-DeFi-summer of 2020. Today, more than 1.8 million tokens have an aggregate market cap of a little more than $1 trillion. But the top 10 largest protocols and tokens account for over 93% of the total. Do the math. That’s a long, long tail of worthless zombie coins. The vast majority of all tokens die. So why should NFTs be any different? The barrier to entry to create an NFT project in the hope of striking it rich was (and remains) low. Anyone can, and seemingly did, create an NFT collection in a few minutes with a few keystrokes. Related: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto So what happened when a frenzy of trading activity and money flooded into this new corner of the crypto market in mid-2021? The free market responded exactly how it was supposed to: it provided supply. And supply ≠ quality, especially in this industry. We’ve seen the same cycle again and again, this just happens to be the first real NFT winter. A-listers have quietly taken their NFT Twitter avatars down. Jimmy Fallon isn’t shilling apes with Paris Hilton on late-night TV. Ashton Kutcher’s Stoner Cats has settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A collective sense of embarrassment abounds. NFT trading volumes have collapsed, from around $1 billion a week in mid-2021 to early-2022, to sub-$100 million today. It’s bleak. But, as I said back in October 2021 about NFTs, “Peaks and troughs are nothing new, it\u0027s what emerges from them which is what\u0027s worth paying attention to.” For those curious and open-minded enough to look beneath the surface of the “NFTs are dead” generalization prevalent today, there are signs of life amidst the rubble. In September, news emerged that PayPal filed a patent application in March surrounding an NFT purchase-and-transfer system. Pudgy Penguins continues to expand into physical toys, first selling on Amazon in March and recently expanding to 2,000 Walmart stores across the U.S. (Disclaimer: I own a fat penguin jpeg.) Doodles have collaborated with casual footwear brand Crocs in a similar effort to merge the physical and digital, with a likewise similar collaboration between Gary Vee’s Veefriends and Reebok. At a concert over the summer, Harry Styles fans could download an app featuring a self-custodial digital wallet for future NFT rewards. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber is collaborating with a blockchain music platform to turn a song into an NFT with royalty streams to the NFT holders. The top auction houses continue to bring mainstream artists into the NFT world, Keith Haring with Christies for example, and Sotheby’s partnering with Ledger to offer a co-branded Ledger Nano X (hardware wallet) for buyers of premier digital art. If you keep looking you’ll find more and more signs of life, because NFTs are not “dead.” The fundamental technological primitive of what NFTs are and what they offer will not “die,” any more than blockchain will “die.” They will simply continue to evolve while the weak hands, weak teams, scams, copycats, and fast money fade into history, another footnote from another crypto cycle. As we transition from this NFT winter into a new season, expect to see NFT projects that are more sophisticated and commercially viable, enriching the ecosystem in new and meaningful ways.

An anonymous X (formerly Twitter) account called NFT Ethics tagged the platform, asking it to speak to the accusations. They claimed Pawlak is linked to the pseudonymous identity “0xSisyphus” and was involved in “various dubious business dealings.“ Continue reading The astrology-themed NFT project Lucky Star Currency (LSC) has been caught in the middle of trying to pull off an exit scam for more than $1 million, according to a report from the blockchain security firm CertiK.

The deal occurred on the OpenSea market on Oct. 9. The NFT represents “a small, warty, amphibious creature,” one of the 6,969 units minted by the pseudonymous digital artist Gremplin. The CrypToadz collection was launched during the NFT boom of 2021 and surpassed a trading volume of 12,000 Ether (ETH) ($38 million) during its first 10 days on the market. The purchasing wallet was funded by a wallet that has been pulling money out of Tornado Cashhttps://t.co/nNhKvSVhoz pic.twitter.com/aInHO8vNyG However, the price paid by the anonymous user for the NFT raised questions among the community. Two weeks ago, this item was acquired for 0.95 ETH (around $1,600), only to be sold for a price a thousand times higher. Related: North Korean Lazarus Group amasses over $40M in Bitcoin, data reveals Moreover, the purchase was funded from a digital wallet, which has been a part of the chain of transactions, anonymized by the Ethereum coin mixing service Tornado Cash. The new owner of the CrypToadz NFT received 1,115.9 ETH ($1.6 million) on Oct. 5. Although some X (Twitter) users preferred to qualify the weird purchase as a “fat finger mistake” during the transaction, it could be an example of wash trading, a tactic to withdraw funds of suspicious origin through a long chain of deals and exchanges. Tornado Cash is famous for its popularity among scammers seeking to wash their funds. In August 2023, the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) even announced sanctions against the crypto mixer for its alleged role in laundering crime proceeds. However, these sanctions couldn’t completely cut off the mixer’s usage. For example, in July 2023, almost $60 million in Ether, stolen from the AnubisDAO two years earlier, was moved via Tornado Cash. The person possessing the 13,556 ETH divided and transferred the funds into 100 ETH transactions.",

Rug pulls from Chinese projects have become a recurring problem in the Web3 space. Running a centralized cryptocurrency exchange is illegal in the country.

Over $100 million was lost in July when the China-based Multichain protocol drained all of its users’ funds into an attacker’s account. The team alleges that police have arrested their CEO, but victims are still searching for answers as to what happened to their funds and how they can be reimbursed.",

Using blockchain technology to give more control to gamers turned out to be a fascinating idea and catapulted Web3 gaming to the main stage of Web3 space. Web3 gaming applies key principles of blockchain technology - including decentralization, true ownership and community - to video games. Blockchain has enabled the creation of concepts such as play-to-earn (P2E), nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and more to cater to the needs of true players who don’t want to escape exploitation by the Web2 monopoly.  The fast growth of Web3 gaming, however, makes it hard to track the most promising projects and chart the map of the blockchain-based gaming ecosystem.

Cointelegraph sat down with Danilo Carlucci, the founder of investment firm Morningstar Ventures and 37xDubai, which is based in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). Carlucci spoke about its goals with the new art gallery and why it is diving into NFTs and Web3 despite the conditions of current markets. Carlucci says the gallery is “an effort to bridge art and technology in one place.” Being a more traditional venture capital fund, the executive said the art gallery is Morningstar Venture’s way to diversify into the more creative digital art and NFT space. He said: Apart from displaying NFTs inside the gallery, the 37xDubai founder also highlighted that it is using NFTs that are inspired by its Tree of Life art installation as a membership token. The executive said it will also support events and various workshops around the adoption of Web3 technology. He said the project has advisers from Binance NFT and Binance Charity who will help it with these endeavors. Related: First look at the Bitcoin Tower in Dubai: Dev shares initial design When asked why it’s diving into NFTs, given the sentiments and data showing that NFT market prices are not what they used to be, Carlucci expressed his belief in the technology and explained why these NFTs in the gallery would be different. He said that while it’s not an NFT-only gallery, it does “believe in NFTs.” He also highlighted that the NFTs in the gallery have a different goal to those created by tech companies. “For the artists that we work with and we handpick. The incentive is creative. They want to make something creative, and they just happen to use blockchain technology for authentication purposes and for maybe sometimes the creative purpose, but the incentive is always creative,” he explained.

    "fullContent": "Decentralization could help bring scientists in underfunded fields and locations to the table without requiring relocation or re-employment\nThe Nature science journal recently published an editorial in its Nature biotechnology section lauding decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as a revolutionary new method by which researchers working in underfunded scientific fields can create communities around their work and raise funding that, otherwise, might not be available. In a DAO-based research scheme, a project’s organization, fundraising, feedback, and pipeline from discovery to product/industry can all be handled by the same decentralized governing body. Per the Nature article, the general workflow would also be streamlined compared to the status quo: Funding can vary wildly from one scientific endeavor to another. During boom and bust periods, research into areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing might receive huge boons from Big Tech, government and follow-on investors, while sectors that may have been well-funded previously, such as longevity and those that have been traditionally underfunded, like women’s health issues, for example, may find funding increasingly difficult to secure. DAOs are built on blockchain technology. This allows a DAO to function on a digital ledger that is transparent and decentralized, meaning a single entity or institution doesn’t control it. In the science world, this allows project funding and community interaction can be democratized. Related: DAOs need to learn from Burning Man for mainstream adoption Traditionally, scientists working at or with the most prestigious institutions — major universities in countries with high GDPs, government institutions and contractors, Big Tech and big pharma companies — receive the most funding and access the most potential funding. The distinction is important because, as scientists leave geographical areas with less funding to pursue research in wealthier areas, the “brain drain” associated with emigration is compounded. And, because DAOs don’t necessarily have to respect borders (though the legalities surrounding their operation can vary by location), they can be governed by the needs and wishes of the research scientists, not the country, university or company sponsoring it. Ultimately, the Nature editorial staff concludes that DAOs could become a crucial platform for underfunded researchers, but adoption will require further education. “Part of this challenge is helping possible members realize that the DAO is not just a funding body,” the staff writes, “but also a community of people who care strongly about supporting a particular scientific cause.”",

    "fullContent": "Lamina1 CEO Rebecca Barkin told Cointelegraph that as long as people continue to invest time and money in digital experiences, the metaverse will continue to come to life.\nThe blockchain project launched by Neal Stephenson, who coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992 book, Snow Crash, is pushing forward with its vision despite waning interest in it and some declaring that it’s “dead.” Compared with its peak in 2021 and 2022, search interest for the metaverse has declined in 2023, according to data from Google Trends. The declining interest in the metaverse has also led some to declare that the metaverse hype is dead. Despite the waning interest and the declarations that it’s dead, some keep their heads down and build. In a statement, Lamina1 — the metaverse blockchain project founded by Stephenson — said it’s holding a month-long event in October called the Open Metaverse Discovery Month. The firm will hold workshops and provide joint quests and bounties to equip builders and creators with the knowledge to explore metaverse experiences.

Related: Metaverse sneak peek: Project aims to build a creator-focused economy through blockchain Rebecca Barkin, the CEO of Lamina1, remains optimistic in the metaverse despite assumptions that it’s dead. Barkin told Cointelegraph in a statement that despite the crypto winter and what many describe as the “death of the metaverse,” it was able to attract almost 50,000 builders into its community since it launched the project. Barkin is optimistic that its founder’s vision of the metaverse will survive as long as people are willing to invest their time and money. The executive told Cointelegraph: According to Barkin, Stephenson’s vision of the metaverse wasn’t just about building virtual worlds. The CEO said it’s about challenging “corporate greed and control.” She added that with today’s technology, it’s now possible to “give more autonomy to creators across entertainment, gaming, commerce, fashion and beyond to build, create and distribute these worlds on their own.” Magazine: Web3 Gamer: Zuckerberg’s metaverse losses, NFT game on Discord, Gods Unchained hot take",

September saw major developments in the space, such as Farmville co-creator Amitt Mahajan raising $33 million to create Web3 games and Animoca Brands disclosing $20 million capital acquired to push forward the development of its Mocaverse platform. In another related development, Blockchain Capital closed two new funds in September, with $580 million to be deployed in crypto gaming and decentralized finance projects in the coming months. Cointelegraph’s venture capital (VC) roundup reveals the latest projects raising capital despite the market’s long downward trend. Data visualization startup Bubblemaps secured 3 million euros ($3.2 million) in a seed funding round spearheaded by INCE Capital. According to the startup, the funding will be used to grow its team, recruit additional developers, and expand its social media marketing initiatives. Stake Capital, Momentum 6, Lbank, V3ntures, Nicolas Bacca of Ledger, Dyma Budorin of Hacken and French entrepreneur Owen Simonin also contributed to the funding. The company has the ambitious goal of becoming the Google Analytics of Web3. Partnerships have reportedly been set up with Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche and BNB Chain. We\u0027re thrilled to share the closing of 2 new funds – our 6th early stage fund and 1st opportunity fund. Together, they total $580 million and serve to reinforce our commitment to leading the global transition to decentralized, blockchain-based systems. ↓https://t.co/Vr2uYnGlF7 Crypto analytics platform CoinScan raised $6.3 million in September. It seeks to offer safety checks, holders and airdrop analysis and social sentiment analysis across the crypto community. CoinScan is the first product from CryptoHub, which is a Web3 company focused on the blockchain economy and backed by DraftKings’ top individual shareholder and billionaire, Shalom MecKenzie, alongside investors from Playtech and iAngels. “Crypto, much like sports betting, should give people the tools and data to make their own assessments about risk and reward,” said MecKenzie in a statement, claiming CoinScan will provide data pulled from multiple sources to provide charting insights. Mythic Protocol closed a $6.5 million seed round co-led by Shima Capital’s founder, Yida Gao, alongside Alpha JWC, Saison Capital, GDP Ventures, Planetarium Labs and others. The team behind the project is working in a collaborative entertainment ecosystem that utilizes a game-first strategy to acquire, retain and scale users. The funds will be deployed in the coming months to develop and launch the initial core offerings focusing on gamers, creators, and investors. “With a founding team that has launched over 250 game titles since 2009 from one of the biggest gaming studios in SEA, we have no doubt that they will carry their track record of success into the next cycle of gaming,” said Gao. Technology company ConsenSys announced the launch of its pre-accelerator program, ConsenSys Fellowship, to support early-stage Web3 startups. The fellowship aims to help early-stage startups bridge the gap between an idea with potential and a functional business, product or tool. The 12-week program will offer guided workshops, weekly curricula, mentorship and access to ConsenSys’ network to accelerate up to 15 startups. Fellowship teams will be eligible for follow-on investments from a $1.5 million fund. Magazine: ‘AI has killed the industry’ — EasyTranslate boss on adapting to change",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-securitization-on-steroids-franklin-templeton-ceo",
    "fullContent": "At CNBC’s Delivering Alpha event, Jenny Johnson discussed how digital assets disrupt securitization and the financial markets.\nSecuritization, a practice with over 50 years of history, is undergoing a dramatic transformation, believes Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset managers. During CNBC’s Delivering Alpha event, Johnson said tokenization — the process of converting asset ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain — is akin to “securitization done on steroids,” a term often used to describe something that exceeds expectations. Johnson’s remarks were part of an analysis of the future of alternative investment vehicles. The executive noted that available capital and technology disruption have attracted more companies and CEOs to invest in “things for the future,” like blockchain technology. Johnson said: Johnson used Rihanna as an example to illustrate her point of view. In February, the singer released one of her popular songs as a nonfungible token (NFT), allowing holders to partially earn royalties on streaming. “My favorite example is Rihanna,” she commented about the NFT collection launched just before the Super Bowl. “I know she’s just testing the market in these 300 NFTs [...]. Well, why can she do that? She can do it because when Spotify plays a Rihanna song, it can capture the smart contract, execute and say: ‘I owe royalties here so nobody has to be involved in it.‘ And it can take the fractional payment and go to Frank, a big Rihanna fan.” Athletes can also benefit from tokenization, according to Johnson: “Think [about] athletes are going to sign a big contract. They’ll say to their fans ‘I’m going to sell off tokens worth 10% of my future revenue stream.‘ I’m going to sell 100,000 tokens and boom, the fans are probably going to pay a premium for it. So it will be a way and if you think about it, it’s just securitization done on steroids.” 1/ The Future is Tokenized Culture Franklin Templeton’s Jenny Johnson nails it at CNBC ‘Delivering Alpha’. - Tokenization \u003d Securitization on Steroids - Tokenization of Cultural IP via NFT Royalty Streams.

    "fullContent": "Pond0x reported that its DEX reached $100 million in cumulative volume, citing a Dune dashboard as evidence.\nThe Pond0X decentralized exchange (DEX) has reached more than $100 million in total trading volume, according to a Sept. 28 social media post from its official channel. Investors previously lost over $2 million in the launch of the exchange’s native token, PNDX, when it turned out to have a function that allowed anyone to transfer it without the owner’s permission. But supporters claim these losses were not the fault of the developer. $108,000,000 Trade Volume ✅ And counting. What comes next…? pic.twitter.com/lpetFqJAkq As evidence for the Pond0X’s trading volume, the official channel cited a Dune dashboard created by user Mogie, which shows over $111 million in all-time trading volume as of Sept. 29. The PNDX token launched on July 28. At the time, critics accused the project of being a rug pull or exit scam. At issue was the unorthodox way that the project’s founder, Jeremy Cahen (also known as “Pauly”), launched the coin. In the launch post on X (formerly Twitter), Cahen posted the URL to an app that allowed people to deposit a fixed amount of Ether (ETH) to receive a fixed amount of PNDX. He also posted the contract address for the token. In response, some investors started buying the coin on Uniswap, using its contract address to identify it, while others deposited ETH into the app to receive PNDX. The price on Uniswap quickly rose above that of the ETH needed to mint PNDX, so minters started selling their coins into the market at a profit. Critics claimed that this process transferred over $2 million of wealth from those who bought the coin on Uniswap to those who minted it using the app. The ETH deposited through the app went into a contract that contained no means of reclaiming the funds, leading critics to allege that the whole project was intended to drain funds from investors and send them to Cahen. In addition, coding experts began claiming that the token lacked a normal transfer function. Instead of only allowing the token owner to transfer it, PNDX allowed anyone to transfer tokens. This meant that each PNDX owner could lose their tokens at any moment, since any programmer could “steal” their PNDX using developer tools. On July 29, Solidity enthusiast and blogger Sm-stack claimed they ran a test in Foundry that proved this point. However, more than two months after the project’s launch, it continues to garner hundreds of supporters on Twitter, with replies to official posts routinely saying such things as “FEELS GOOD MAN” and “Best DEX, don’t see a reason for people to use other tbh.” Best DEX, don’t see a reason for people to use other tbh On July 29, crypto trader and blogger Antony Williams claimed to have read the app’s smart contract code and determined how it works. According to him, Pond0x is “fundamentally an LP Farm” and not a complete scam. The app issues each user an ID that determines the user’s share of a pool of Pepe (PEPE) tokens. Users can increase the Pepe rewards they are entitled to by calling the “BribeforLevelUp” function. To call this function, the user must deposit 0.26 ETH. This ETH is used to purchase Pepe tokens, which then get deposited into the pool to pay out rewards. The exchange also issues a “Score” to each user. Higher scores represent more potential rewards from trading fees collected, all other factors being held constant. Related: BALD token developer denies rug pull as price falls 85% post-launch Williams did not say these rewards could be claimed immediately but asserted that the developer “likely” intends to pay them out at some point in the future. He also claims that the PNDX token “is essentially valueless,” which may have been created in this way “to avoid legal complications.” The project launched its decentralized exchange on Sept. 1. According to the Dune dashboard cited above, the DEX has now reached over $100 million in trading volume, showing that at least some traders are undeterred by Pond0X criticism.",

Maggie’s Edinburgh — an institution dedicated to free cancer treatment — received 114,000 pounds from Trevor Jones, a popular crypto artist from Scotland, who raised funds at a charity exhibition and auction at an annual Web3 Castle Party near Paris. According to Maggie’s Edinburgh Fundraising, the funds collected by Jones amounted to the highest single donation from an art event recorded in the Edinburgh Center’s 27-year history. A spokesperson representing Maggie’s Edinburgh attributed the success to “the support and enthusiasm of the NFT art community.” The total money raised from the fundraiser will go toward helping 4,000 people impacted by cancer and locals who need vital support. The exhibition held at Château de Vallery near Paris saw participation from 30 artists.

    "fullContent": "Inscriptions have been acting more as a “packing filler,” stuffed into any remaining space once higher-value monetary transfers are packed into blocks, said the firm.\nDespite concerns that Bitcoin Ordinals are clogging the network, there is little evidence to suggest inscriptions are taking blockspace away from higher-value Bitcoin (BTC) monetary transfers. “There is minimal evidence that inscriptions are displacing monetary transfers,” on-chain analytics firm Glassnode explained its Sept. 25 “The Week On-chain” report. The firm explained that this is likely because inscription users tend to set low fee rates, expressing a willingness to wait longer periods of time for confirmation. Bitcoin Ordinals were introduced in February 2023 and have since accounted for the lion’s share of network activity when it comes to daily transaction count. However, this hasn’t necessarily been reflected in its share of mining fees, with inscriptions only attributing to about 20% of Bitcoin transaction fees, Glassnode noted. While inscriptions have strengthened the base-load demand for blockspace and increased fees for miners, Glassnode says Bitcoin’s hash rate has also increased 50% since February. This has resulted in tougher competition for miners looking to swoop in on revenue fees, says Glassnode: Bitcoin is currently priced at $26,216, but many industry pundits expect some degree of price appreciation in the lead-up to Bitcoin’s halving event scheduled for April 2024.

The BRC-20 standard was launched in March by anonymous developer “Domo.” Within two months, the BRC-20 market cap reached $1 billion, with PEPE and ORDI among the most notable BRC-20 tokens created on Bitcoin. New terrible idea just dropped: Runes. A worse-is-better fungible token protocol for Bitcoin.https://t.co/TPVrUvWxm8 BRC-20 enables the minting and transfer of fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin. But the issue with BRC-20 tokens is that they spam Bitcoin with “junk” unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs, argues Rodarmor. BRC-20 tokens have the “undesirable consequence of UTXO proliferation,” he explained in a Sept. 25 blog post, proposing Runes as a UTXO-based alternative. TLDR on Runes - A potential fungible token protocol for Bitcoin ᚱᚢᚾᛖᛊ - Casey remains skeptical, citing \"99.9% are scams and memes,\" but recognises they don\u0027t appear to be going away. - Employs a UTXO-based system, notably simpler than BRC-20. - Uses the letter \u0027R\u0027 in the… https://t.co/zYP43f70gh “If this protocol had a small on-chain footprint and encouraged responsible UTXO management, it might serve as harm reduction compared to existing protocols,” Rodarmor added. UTXOs represent the amount of cryptocurrency left in a wallet following a completed transaction, where the balance is used in subsequent transactions and is stored in the UTXO database. Bitcoin’s UTXO model plays a role in making Bitcoin an auditable and transparent ledger by preventing the double-spending problem. Rodarmor said other fungible token protocols on Bitcoin, such as Really Good for Bitcoin, Counterparty and Omni Layer, have problems of their own. While Rodarmor admitted 99.9% of fungible tokens are filled with scams and memes, he believes the right fungible token protocol can add value to the Bitcoin network: Related: Ordinals still make up majority of Bitcoin txs despite price collapse In a Sept. 25 Twitter Spaces with The Ordinals Show co-host Trevor Owens, Rodarmor said he came up with the Runes idea last week and that he wasn’t sure whether he would pursue it any further.

    "fullContent": "Takashi Murakami said he might step back from NFTs but stay involved differently, Krapoplis is set to debut on Fox this month, and an NFT artist won a multimillion-dollar contract dispute.\nAcclaimed Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami says he may not release any more nonfungible tokens (NFTs) moving forward after first jumping into the market in late 2021. Murakami is a world-renowned artist who has a career spanning back to the late 1980s. He has released two NFT collections to date: the Clone X collection in partnership with RTFKT in December 2021 and the Murakami.Flowers collection in May 2022. Speaking with The Guardian in a Sept. 20 interview at the Asian Art Museum as part of his new solo art exhibition dubbed Unfamiliar People, Murakami simply stated: “Maybe I’m done releasing NFTs.” Murakami.Flowers, in particular, proved to be a challenging project for the artist. He delayed its launch to fine-tune it before eventually rolling it out in May 2022 as the crypto and NFT markets crashed. With floor prices and sales stagnant after the launch, Murakami ultimately apologized to those who bought his NFTs. However, the community seemed to understand at the time, given that broader market factors were at play. Despite this, Murakami.Flowers has generated 26,713 Ether (ETH) or $42.52 million worth of secondary trading volume to date, with an NFT floor price of 0.36 ETH ($573) according to data from OpenSea. NFT artist Danny Casale, also known as Coolman Coffeedan, has won a multimillion-dollar profit-sharing related contract dispute with Web3 art curators DigiArt. According to a Sept. 22 report from ArtNet, Casale signed on to be repped by DigiArt back in May 2021, with the firm helping him gain exposure in exchange for a 50-50 split of his NFT sales and the exclusive “right to market and offer for sale all non-fungible tokens created by Casale” up until the contract expired on May 2, 2022. However, DigiArt sued Casale in March 2023 over an alleged breach of contract after the artist launched an NFT project by himself on Dec. 21, 2021, called Coolman’s Universe. The project consists of 10,000 cartoon avatar NFTs and, to date, has generated 26,399 ETH ($42 million) of secondary sales, according to data from OpenSea. DigiArt alleged that Casale “wholly ignored his contractual obligations” by launching the project but failed to list any specific monetary damages in the complaint. The firm also admitted to not attempting to enforce the agreement until months after the project had launched. Additionally, DigiArt also did not provide a written start date on the contract with Casale, along with several other important details. This ultimately led Judge Wendy Berger of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida to rule in favor of Casale and dismiss the case. “The draft contained several blanks, including the effective date, the name of the artist, and the allocation of net sale proceeds…in the body of the e-mail, [DigiArt’s] representative stated that the profit split would be ’50/50’ ‘on initial NFT drops,‘” the court document read. Krapopolis, the NFT-linked animated series from Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon, is finally set to air in September after being announced in June 2021. The show is set to debut with the first two episodes on Fox on Sept. 24 and will then feature on Fox’s Animation Domination series block alongside The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bob’s Burgers, starting from Oct. 1. Only 2 days left until #Krapopolis takes you on a legendary adventure, premiering on September 24th! The magic is almost here! pic.twitter.com/sb6E8oLGxV Krapopolis is a comedy set in ancient Greece that follows a “flawed family of humans, gods and monsters that try to run one of the world’s first cities without killing each other.” The show’s NFTs are called “Krap Chickens” and depict cartoon chicken avatars in the same art style as the show. There are 10,420 NFTs in total, and holders are given benefits such as voting rights for certain aspects of the show and exclusive rewards, content and experiences. While mainstream media outlets have recently captured attention by claiming that NFTs are “finally totally worthless,” a digital artist from rural Victoria, Australia, has highlighted a key use case for the tech: expanding the exposure of regional/remote creatives. Speaking with ABC on Sept. 22, Warracknabeal-based artist Ben Fowler emphasized that tokenizing his artwork enabled him to reach a global audience and help his career grow from home without ever having to move to cities like Melbourne that are hours away. “I listed my piece Astral Travel Sickness … that sold in a matter of like three days, and at the equivalent of 0.34 Ether, which at the time was worth about $930,” he said, adding, “Then I added another one, and it sold, and another … people kept resonating and buying it, and I started meeting new people, and it just took off.“ Related: NFTs are ‘totally worthless’ says mainstream media, community responds Bitcoin Ordinals’s creator and chief coder, Casey Rodarmor, has recently proposed changing the protocol’s numbering system with the aim of simplifying the project’s codebase.

    "fullContent": "A community member highlighted the drastic shift in mainstream media narrative, sharing a previous article promoting the BAYC NFT collection.\nMainstream media outlet Rolling Stone has declared that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are “finally totally worthless,” citing the results of a DappGambl study on the “evolving landscape” of NFTs. The study found that as many as 95% of NFTs (owned by more than 23 million investors) have no value at all. According to DappGambl, the study titled \"Dead NFTs: The Evolving Landscape of the NFT Market\" analyzed 73,257 NFT collections. Among the thousands of collections, the researchers found that 69,795 of the collections have a market capitalization of zero Ether (ETH). Despite NFTs grabbing headlines after selling for millions, the study also showed that less than 1% of NFTs have a price tag of over $6,000. This shows that high-value NFT assets are very rare. After the report was published, the response from the community has been varied, with some agreeing with the report and others linking previous reports from the outlet that supported the same NFTs they’ve now called out. In a Reddit thread, most of the comments agreed with the report. Some called NFTs the “worst things to emerge from crypto,” and others claimed that they were “worthless ages ago.” Despite this, a community member believes that, while they may be worthless now, this may change in the future. “Some will make a comeback. Some will go up 1000% because bull. People will get mad again that pixels are worth millions,” they wrote. On X, a community member shared a previous Rolling Stone article promoting the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection in an attempt to highlight the change in narrative within the media outlet. Meanwhile, another community member believes that when mainstream media shares these types of posts, a “reversal” is bound to happen, while another backed up the statement by saying that “now is the time to buy.” Related: Ronaldo teases NFT plans while on a lie detector test On Aug. 3, Ethereum gas usage for NFTs fell significantly, signaling a potential shift in NFT usage, with users holding on to their assets instead of actively trading. In 2021, NFTs were on top in terms of gas usage on the Ethereum network, showing that NFT holders were actively trading and moving their assets. Two years later, NFT marketplaces that once dominated the gas usage charts have now fallen off the list. Magazine: NFT Collector: Creative AI art, Tomorrowland sells tomorrow’s future",

According to Rodarmor, the move will simplify the protocol’s codebase and make it easier to make protocol changes easier in the future. The coder also clarified that inscription numbers would change but not be entirely scrapped. Rodarmor highlighted that new inscription numbers would be close to the old ones but might differ by 1%. While many supported the move, others pointed out how users paid substantial amounts to get specific numbers and would be affected by the reorganization of numbers. Despite this, a community member noted that those who care about the numbering of the inscriptions can still sort the collectibles by their timestamps.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/gala-games-how-to-buy-gala-coin",
    "fullContent": "Gala Games is a blockchain-based gaming platform enabling players to create, own, and trade in-game assets using cryptocurrencies.\nEchoing the momentum of GameFi (gaming and finance) and the great success of Axie Infinity, Gala Games was launched in 2019 to pursue technology development and innovation in play-to-earn (P2E) blockchain gaming. The global market size of blockchain gaming exceeded $4.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach around $65.7 billion by 2027, establishing itself as one of the most promising sectors revolutionized by blockchain technology. Gala Games offers players a plethora of blockchain games that encourage players to gain in-game rewards and earn cryptocurrency and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). For the first time, through the use of NFTs, blockchain games offer players the ability to own in-game items, such as strategic tools, physical accessories and land. All items can be acquired in Gala Games using the GALA native token (GALA). GALA is also used for governance voting and to incentivize node operators. This article takes readers through an understanding of the Gala ecosystem, how Gala Games works, and what the incentives are for using it. Gala Games is a blockchain gaming platform that participants can use to play, stake and sell assets and compete with one another. The platform uses blockchain technology to secure the network and offers decentralized video games to allow players to have fun while earning rewards like NFT prizes. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, Gala Games offers players P2E games, an NFT marketplace, and the possibility to store and distribute music and film products. It relies on a network of distributed user-owned nodes necessary for the platform’s security and to boost its development. Players and user-owned nodes are rewarded with the GALA ERC-20 token for playing and contributing to the network. It is the necessary currency to participate in the platform’s games, trade NFTs on the marketplace, and cast a governance vote. The Gala Games ecosystem offers a multitude of blockchain games developed by in-house developers and external partners, including Ember Entertainment, Kung Fu Factory, Gamedia, Certain Affinity and 22cans. It launched as a platform for users who want to play and have fun rather than a platform that only uses incentives to attract customers. Gala Network users can enjoy real-time strategy (RTS), multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and role-playing game (RPG) titles all while being rewarded with the GALA cryptocurrency and NFTs for using the platform. NFTs represent in-game items, such as weapons, tools and skins, that users actually own and can trade on the Gala Store — also known as its nonfungible marketplace — and OpenSea, one of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces. Gala Games’ platform was developed on Ethereum; however, the Gala team launched its own blockchain (Project GYRI) in February 2022. Initially permissioned, the Gala blockchain aims to transition to a more decentralized platform for maximum autonomy in the peer-to-peer transfer of value. One of the features the Gala team promotes is incentivizing players to run their own nodes for an opportunity to earn the GALA cryptocurrency, limited edition NFTs and the chance to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. To operate their own node, users must buy a license for roughly $100. The Gala Games platform is run by a distributed network of nodes ensuring decentralization rather than a central server controlled by a single entity. These nodes offer their computational resources to contribute to the ecosystem, vote on community proposals, and help guide the network’s development. There are four different types of nodes, as follows: The founders of Gala Games are Eric Schiermeyer, Michael McCarthy and Wright Thurston, who launched the project in 2019. Schiermeyer had previously co-founded Zynga, an online gaming platform that developed popular games, such as Farmville, Mafia Wars and many others. Also, McCarthy worked at Zynga as a director before moving on to Gala. Gala Games entered the market in 2019, and since its launch, Gala has secured some significant partnerships with Flare, Mazer Gaming, Bitrue, Brave, Ember Games and AMC, which helped promote the project and increase its market penetration. The primary use case for the GALA token is to be a medium of exchange between participants in the Gala Games ecosystem and to purchase digital assets, including NFTs. The GALA token can be an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token or a BNB Smart Chain-based BEP-20 token and is used in various ways across the Gala platforms. It can be a reward incentive for Founder Node operators or a governance token that allows its owners to vote on the project’s future developments. It can also be in the form of in-game player rewards and can be used to purchase NFTs from the Gala Store. Users can also spend it to buy a license required to operate a Gala node. While Gala Games has been developed to run mainly on Ethereum, the GALA token can be used on platforms such as Polygon and bridged to the BNB Smart Chain so that users can enjoy better trading fees when transferring value. Gala’s total supply is approximately 50 billion, and each day, a pre-determined amount of new GALA tokens are distributed to the Founder Nodes and the Gala Games Conservatorship, which is Gala Games’ treasury. The daily issuance is cut in half every year, and in July 2023, it was slightly fewer than 4.3 million tokens. Players can earn GALA in games, and investors can buy GALA from a number of cryptocurrency providers, including major exchanges such as Kraken and Binance. Kraken offers to trade GALA with the United States dollar and euro only, while Binance provides a broader choice of cryptocurrencies — other than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) — that can be exchanged with the GALA token. Coinbase only allows you to buy Gala with a Coinbase wallet from a decentralized exchange. Investors must have an account with their provider of choice and verify their identity to start acquiring GALA; select the currency that will buy the token, click “buy,” and once the transaction has gone through, they can either store the token within the exchange (not recommended) or withdraw it to store it in a private and secure wallet. As the blockchain-based gaming industry keeps expanding, it is fair to predict that GameFi will play a significant role in the future of entertainment. In 2021, Gala Games sealed a partnership with crypto investment firm C2 Ventures to form a $100-million fund to invest in advancing the play-to-earn gaming and metaverse markets. Gala Games also received funding from Binance’s Accelerator Fund for its development. Such funding was a positive outcome for Gala Games investors looking for the project’s reliability, opportunities and innovation. Whether Gala Games is a good investment or not is up to the investor to decide after proper research and assessment. Indeed, from a future perspective, GameFi is a promising branch of finance that uses blockchain technology to leverage security and decentralization, encouraging widespread optimism across the financial world.",

Today we’re releasing support for cNFTs (find them in our popular collections) cNFTs are a new wave of NFT creation only possible on Solana. The \"c\" stands for compressed (not Cardano don\u0027t worry) which allows them to be produced at a fraction of the cost of traditional… pic.twitter.com/WbO4qqWLEt CNFTs differ from the usual Solana NFTs because their data is compressed and stored off-chain. Because of this, production in larger quantities is more feasible as they require lesser fees to mint. According to Magic Eden, this type of NFT is ideal for creating mass-produced collections in various industries like gaming, music, events and the metaverse. The NFT marketplace believes that it allows creators to reach wider audiences without spending more. The NFT marketplace also believes that by lowering the costs involved in NFT production, it can potentially promote adoption and become an “easy access point” for new people to try out collecting NFTs. With lower costs, users can collect NFTs without risking a large amount of funds to acquire collections. It lowers the risk of losing money over NFTs. CNFTs are powered by Solana’s state compression, a feature that allows as many as 1 million NFTs to be minted with just around $110. Compared with minting NFTs on Ethereum, which could cost anywhere from $2.9 to over $30 to mint per NFT, the cost of minting is drastically lowered with cNFTs.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/play-to-earn-why-gamers-hate-crypto-atari-founder",
    "fullContent": "Crypto games have garnered a bad reputation among traditional gamers, but the future of Web3 games and blockchain-based worlds is far from over, says Nolan Bushnell.\nIt’s no secret that traditional gamers harbor a strong sense of disdain for crypto and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in their games. The reason for this is clear, says Atari founder Nolan Bushnell: it all started with the insane rise of play-to-earn games. “I can tell you clearly where this disdain for crypto comes from,” Bushnell said. “The hatred comes from these play-to-earn games that pioneered blockchain gaming.” Speaking to Cointelegraph in a wide-ranging interview, Bushnell — known as the “godfather of video games” — shared his many perspectives on the current gaming landscape and the role blockchain technology will play in the sector moving forward. While it could be seen as outlandish if someone said that they had “invented video games,” — for Bushnell, this was just a part of his long career, including founding the gaming system Atari and the American dining chain Chuck E. Cheese. He is also one of the few people in the world to have counted Steve Jobs as an employee. Bushnell believes the future of Web3 gaming depends on a major shift away from play-to-earn dynamics and a renewed focus on building convincing virtual worlds through the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. The mass adoption of these new worlds, Bushnell explains, will be entirely dependent upon the human need for socialization as well as a permanent sense of “place and time” in the new economy of virtual worlds. Presently, Bushnell serves as the chief knowledge officer at Moxy, a new blockchain-based esports company, where he describes three pillars where blockchain can provide modern gaming with a much-needed upgrade. I\u0027m excited to be speaking at the DELF event. We\u0027ve chosen Hong Kong for https://t.co/GNemkV0YDf\u0027s entrance to the Asian Market https://t.co/phUuANd9LB The first and most important value proposition Bushnell says is the ability to transfer seamlessly and securely. “We want to turn gaming into a platform for competition and in order to have good competition, you need to be able to securely transfer funds simply and easily,” he explained. As the world becomes increasingly digital, there needs to be a way for people to ensure that actions and expectations are aligned with outcomes. “Number two, and it’s a close two, by the way, is the utility of smart contracts. Smart contracts don’t just have value in games but in all human interactions because so much of what we do in life is establish relationships and then set the terms of those relationships.” The third key area is the ability to securely store the value of digital assets in the form of currencies and tokens. Related: Atari founder, Animoca sees Web3 games as vital for virtual ownership and education First introduced to cryptocurrency by Tether co-founder Brock Pierce when Bitcoin (BTC) was hovering around the price of $50, Bushnell said he didn’t take too much notice of crypto at first. However, like many others, he changed his minds when the price of Bitcoin began to surge, and suddenly Bushnell realized that there might be something more going on in the world of blockchain. While Bushnell admits that he doesn’t have much material exposure to cryptocurrencies due to the volatile nature of prices, he concluded that anytime humans are capable of sharing a perception of value en masse, “we’re usually in the clear.” Web3 Gamer: GTA owner joins Web3, Bitcoin casino, Sunflower Land review",

    "fullContent": "SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda described the NFT sales as a “common phenomenon” in the world of creators.\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to charge nonfungible token (NFT) project Stoner Cats sparked feedback from Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, arguing that the project’s activity constitutes fan crowdfunding, which they believe is common for artists. On Sept. 13, the SEC charged Stoner Cats 2 LLC, the firm behind the animated series “Stoner Cats,” with conducting an unregistered crypto-securities offering using NFTs. Stoner Cats 2 LLC agreed to a cease-and-desist order and other measures imposed by the commission. Making its case, the SEC argued that the NFTs were marketed by the company as having potential for secondary sales and implied that their value would rise. In addition, the SEC pointed out that the company receives a 2.5% royalty on every secondary sale. The SEC highlighted that the company sold over 10,000 NFTs for $800 each, with the proceeds used to fund the series. Furthermore, there were at least 10,000 secondary sales, worth over $20 million, according to the SEC. There has been a lot of talk about cats at the SEC over the past week: https://t.co/VHFt4CVEV0 and https://t.co/pFXmkGxd2r However, not everyone within the SEC agrees with the enforcement action. Peirce and Uyeda published a dissenting statement, arguing that the activity could be considered fan crowdfunding. Pierce and Uyeda argued that this is “a common phenomenon in the world of artists, creators, and entertainers.\" They also noted that instead of the SEC’s approach of bringing actions against NFT projects, it should lay down clear rules. The commissioners wrote: The commissioners also compared the Stoner Cats NFTs to collectibles sold by Star Wars in the 1970s. According to Pierce and Uyeda, toy company Kenner sold early-bird certificates redeemable for future action figures and membership to the Star Wars fan club. The duo argued that based on the actions against Stoner Cats, the SEC should’ve “parachuted in” to save those buyers back in the 70s. Related: Crypto lawyer about SEC: ‘Problematic to imply all NFTs are securities’ Apart from the SEC commissioners, members of the crypto community were also unhappy with the SEC’s actions. YouTuber Crypto Tea argued in a post that Stoner Cats raised money to make a show and delivered. The social influencer said that she bought the NFTs for fun and to support the show without expecting any profits. An artist should always be able to say “buy my art, it will become the most expensive art in the Universe”. To forbid an artist from making an ostentatious claim about the value of their own work would dull the world. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko also expressed his opinion about the topic on X (formerly Twitter). According to Yakovenko, artists should not be forbidden to make claims about the value of their work. Yakovenko believes that doing this would “dull the world.” Magazine: NFT collapse and monster egos feature in new Murakami exhibition",

    "fullContent": "While Meta’s Horizon Worlds is suffering from a low user base, metaverse platforms have focused on building, says Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre.\nBig Tech player Meta gave the metaverse a bad name when it pushed its janky vision to the masses. Luckily, open online virtual worlds have continued to evolve, says Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre. Speaking to Cointelegraph at Token 2049 in Singapore, Alegre said the problem with the metaverse is that Meta “ruined the term because it said: ‘This is something brand new’” — despite other metaverse platforms already existing. Alegre said the low userbase is a core issue of Meta’s Horizon Worlds — but it’s otherwise useful if only “there was a reason to be there.” He added that,unlike Horizon Worlds, Yuga’s upcoming Otherside metaverse — in development since at least March 2022 with no official launch date — came from a need by their community of nonfungible tokenholders to have a digital space to connect. Otherside Test Group: A Recap pic.twitter.com/57gh9g8VlA “The digital connection is what they\u0027ve asked us to do,” Alegre said. “At its core, [Otherside] is a way for our community to connect digitally in one location.” So far, Otherside has only been glimpsed through a handful of early access demos and a “vibe check” by a focus group in July. Alegre said Yuga recently conducted another limited experience of Otherside with “core members.” Otherside’s up-and-running peer, The Sandbox, has also sought to bring culture online, with its co-founder Sebastien Borget telling Cointelegraph that it’s creating neighborhoods on its platform that mirror countries such as Singapore and Türkiye. Alegre said he’s also seeing a divergence in how NFTs are being viewed. On one hand, NFTs are being valued purely for their art and history. On the other, they’re being valued for their community and intellectual property rights. “Those are two avenues that this is all going down,” he opined. He compared the use cases between the NFT projects CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) — both Yuga-owned properties where holders own the commercial IP — to highlight how holders use them. CryptoPunks — an early NFT collection — are being exposed to “top museums and collectors,” who are starting to see the value of owning the original, according to Alegre. Related: Shrapnel Web3 shooter won\u0027t let US users cash out, thanks to Gensler Meanwhile, BAYC holders have created a community and Alegre claims “more than 900 holders of Apes are building businesses on top of the Apes.” He said Yuga was in a similar position to YouTube — where its user-generated content (UGC) model allowed businesses to be built around sharing videos on the platform. “It shows you that NFTs, and NFT ownership, if you give it to the community they take it in ways that you can never imagine,” Alegre said. “Both in the offline space as well as the online space.” Magazine: NFT Collector: Creative AI art, Tomorrowland sells tomorrow’s future",

    "fullContent": "As soon as a gamer cashes out an in-game asset, they realize monetary value, which is where the problem with the Securities and Exchange Commission comes in.\nThe creators of blockchain game Shrapnel — an upcoming AAA first-person extraction shooter — will be cutting a part of its game for United States-based players, in order to avoid the potential ire of the country’s securities regulator. The game, which is due to launch in early access in December, will be unrestricted for players from Europe and Asia, but gamers from the U.S. will not be able to cash out at all, Shrapnel Head of Economy Francis Brankin said in a Sept. 13 interview with Cointelegraph at Token 2049. He hopes the issue will be temporary and that Neon — the team behind Shrapnel — will soon enable U.S. users to bridge capital accrued from Shrapnel to their bank accounts. The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission has seemingly been on a regulatory enforcement parade since Gary Gensler was appointed to its helm, which has prompted many U.S. cryptocurrency firms to restrict local services and look for more opportunities abroad. 〉Getting ready to extract. pic.twitter.com/kq6B07Ub97 Shrapnel is a first-person extraction shooter set on 2038 Earth, where players scavenge for loot and attempt to extract their winnings — all the while being hunted by enemies and other players. The game also allows gamers to build open economies and possess the intellectual property rights over in-game assets as opposed to merely creating value from the game itself, Brankin explained. This was one of the main reasons why the firm’s CEO, Mark Long, decided to go down the blockchain route. Users can build a brand, create and then sell in-game assets from the ground up. “User generated content is clearly a big thing,” Brankin explained, pointing to Roblox and Minecraft as textbook examples. ✦ SHRAPNEL INSIGNIA Beta is now available to the public! ✦ Create your own personalised designs and build out your unique brand!

Shrapnel can currently process 2 million transactions per hour (555 TPS) which is sufficient for the time being but over time it’ll be easier to scale up on Avalanche, Brankin explained. Related: Saudi Arabia looks to blockchain gaming and Web3 to diversify economy Neon will launch an early access version of the game in December to paid users before it evolves into a free-to-play game. While the limitations imposed on U.S. users serves as a roadblock for Shrapnel’s upcoming launch, the co-founder of Sandbox told Cointelegraph the metaverse (and gaming generally) is dying in the U.S. but thriving in Asia — particularly Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-game-gods-unchained-releases-sealed-mode-mimic-paper-card-games",
    "fullContent": "Immutable’s Gods Unchained game has launched a new tournament mode that allows players to build a deck with random cards.\nWeb3 game Gods Unchained released a new gameplay format that allows players to compete with semi-random cards they receive at the start of a tournament. Called “Sealed Mode,” the format is intended to reward highly skilled players, even if they don’t have a large or expensive card collection. The new format was announced via a blog post on Sept. 13. “Sealed deck” tournaments are common in paper collectible trading card games such as Magic: The Gathering, but are relatively rare in digital trading card games. ⚜️ ⚜️ Will you? ️ Coming Sept 14th 11am AET Full details: https://t.co/mKSGSCrMW7 pic.twitter.com/LHCdIs7LjK According to the post, players can participate in sealed mode if they pay an entry fee of 15 Gods Unchained (GODS) tokens, worth approximately $2.65 at the time of publication. Once they pay this fee, they receive a random selection of three gods they can choose to build a deck around. In addition, they receive 60 random cards drawn from multiple Gods Unchained card sets, including Etherbots, Mortal Judgement, Winter Wanderlands and others. Although the pool of cards is semi-random, it also contains a minimum number of cards of specific types to ensure that a viable deck can be built with it. For example, each pool has at least 12 cards that cost 3 mana or less. Related: What is Gods Unchained, and how to play it Out of each player’s pool of 60 cards, they must build a minimum 30-card deck, the post stated. The players must build their decks entirely out of the cards provided and cannot use cards from their own personal collection. After building a deck, players compete until they either lose three matches or win seven. The players with better records at the end of the tournament receive more rewards than the players who have worse records. Some cosmetic rewards are only available in sealed mode and can only be obtained by players who win four matches or more. \"Sealed mode” in Gods Unchained is meant to be similar to “sealed deck” or “draft” tournaments for face-to-face card games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering. Players of these games often use sealed formats to collect cards. However, because most digital card games do not allow players to \"own” their cards in any meaningful sense, sealed tournaments were virtually unknown in the digital card game world. In Gods Unchained, each card is represented by a nonfungible token stored on the Immutable X network, a layer-2 of Ethereum. Gods Unchained was one of the first Web3 video games released by Immutable. In May, Immutable stated it was developing a wallet application called “Passport” that would allow gamers to log in without needing to copy down seed words. On Aug. 15, Immutable released its zkEVM testnet, which it claimed will help scale Ethereum for video game players.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-nft-markets-in-a-death-spiral-or-ready-for-a-resurgence",
    "fullContent": "NFTs have taken a massive hit since the 2021 bull market, but some experts say they could make a comeback.\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) saw a massive surge in popularity in 2021, accompanied by sky-high prices, but the market has since come crashing back to earth, and it’s unclear whether there will be a resurgence. NFTs are unique digital tokens recorded on a blockchain to certify ownership and authenticity. They can’t be copied or substituted but can be transferred and sold by their owner. According to analytics platform NFTGo, the NFT market cap valued in Ether (ETH) is down 40.59% over the past year at the time of writing, with trading volume down 40.81%. The market cap in U.S. dollars is down 41.16%, and its volume has dropped 66.77%. At the same time, market sentiment is ranked 13 out of 100, with an overall rating of “cold.” Arno Bauer, senior solution architect at BNB Chain, told Cointelegraph that from a utility perspective, NFT projects are increasingly adding value and that this growth in functionality is where the future of NFTs likely lies. Bauer said the NFT market is showing “promising signs of innovation and creativity,” which holds great potential for the growth and evolution of the tech. Related: Crypto lawyer about SEC: ‘Problematic to imply all NFTs are securities’ “Market sentiment, cultural shifts towards digital ownership, and the potential for NFTs to be integrated into various aspects of our lives also contribute to a positive outlook for the future of NFTs,” he said. “While current market conditions might seem subdued, the ongoing innovation and potential for integration with both digital and physical worlds suggest that NFTs have not had their day and that their continued relevance and growth are highly probable,” Bauer added. As for long-term use cases, Bauer said NFTs will “likely evolve” over time and become increasingly linked to real-world assets, such as property ownership or unique physical goods. Currently, NFTs have been most successful in the art world, with some selling for tens of millions of dollars. Digital artist Pak sold an NFT project titled “The Merge” for $91.8 million on Nifty Gateway in 2021, while Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, sold “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for $69.3 million via Christie’s auction house the same year. Blockchain games also use NFTs to represent in-game items such as weapons and armor, and there is speculation the tech will make the jump to mainstream games. Various types of music assets are also being sold as one-of-a-kind NFTs. Bauer thinks that as more robust technology provides enhanced use cases and ownership security, NFTs will likely become more attractive to mainstream markets. He speculated that NFTs could link to financial instruments, representing shares in companies or investment funds, and social achievements, where they could symbolize badges of accomplishment in various fields. “Beyond art, the ability to tokenize unique assets and provide verifiable ownership will create numerous applications across various domains,” Bauer said. “Addressing sustainability concerns could make them more appealing to a broader audience,” he added. Jason Bailey, co-founder and CEO of NFT tool and self-custody solution ClubNFT, told Cointelegraph he thinks “NFTs will come back and go mainstream” because crypto and NFTs rebound cyclically, just like previous tech crashes. According to data gathering platform Statista, the NFT market is projected to continue growing in revenue, users and market capitalization. As of 2023, there are 13.95 million NFT users, but that’s expected to hit 19.31 million users by 2027. However, Bailey believes NFTs currently have some issues, most of which were amplified by rampant market speculation, that need to be solved before NFTs can go mainstream. He said NFTs and the ecosystem around them are so complex that almost everyone is still vulnerable to many risks they may not even know about. “Many of us have been trying to educate and onboard people into the space thoughtfully so they can be safe, but the truth is that NFTs won’t go mainstream until the complexity is replaced with a safe-by-default easy path,” Bailey said. “The steps needed to protect the art from disappearing, and prevent the NFT from breaking, are complicated, time-consuming and error-prone,” he added. Related: AI-based tools bring security and transparency to the NFT market Bailey believes that in the long term, NFTs or similar tech could prove invaluable in validating digital documents such as marriage certificates, diplomas and licenses. Overall, he thinks NFTs solve too many of the current problems associated with digital ownership — including scarcity, authentication, provenance and provable ownership — to be ignored. “We need to build infrastructure now, during the bear market, for smoother onboarding and to protect NFT adopters from malicious actors in the next NFT bull market,” he said. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Andy Ku, founder and CEO of digital content Web3 ecosystem Altava Group, said he thinks the previous highs in the NFT market were based on a hype cycle, so it’ll be hard for an individual NFT to reach such lofty heights again. asked google bard to write me some tweets about NFT market right now... mf really went for the throat on these... pic.twitter.com/aLjUbwH3gT According to CoinGecko, many of the top NFT collections have seen significant drops in value over the past year. At the time of writing, Bored Ape Yacht Club has fallen by 67.1%, CryptoPunks by 33.2%, Mutant Ape Yacht Club by 59.2% and Azuki by 49.3%. Ku believes that if we can see more meaningful NFT projects on the market offering tangible benefits to more people, then it’s possible to have the combined volume bring the overall market value up. Related: What’s next for NFTs and Web3 in the age of the creator economy? “NFTs should offer value and utility beyond just a digital art or PFP. The two areas I particularly believe in are asset-backed NFTs and a membership NFT,” he said. NFTs for subscription, membership-based models and loyalty programs are starting to gain traction, with examples in hospitality venues and gyms already on the market. “In terms of asset-backed NFTs, master artworks, real estate and precious metals like gold are all good examples of assets in which people believe,” Ku said. “NFTs would make a great proof-of-ownership for these assets as well as being extremely portable,” he added.",

    "fullContent": "Milady NFT creator Charlotte Fang said that Remilia “easily identified” the individuals involved in the exploit and will start legal action.\nMilady Maker, a nonfungible token (NFT) project on the Ethereum blockchain, has fallen victim to a major exploit involving the platform’s fees and social media accounts. Charlotte Fang, co-founder of the Milady Maker NFT collection, took to X (formerly Twitter) on Sept. 11 to announce that a developer in the Milady ecosystem has managed to divert about $1 million in generated fees from Remilia Corporation. Remilia is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Milady Maker NFT. The DAO saw its revenue compromised by Bonkler, its experimental finance art project created in April 2023, according to an announcement by Fang. “The Bonkler reserves, main contract and NFTs are safe; only Remilia’s revenue from Bonkler was compromised,” Fang noted. The creator emphasized that Remilia’s reserves are “unaffected” and user assets are “perfectly safe.” In addition to the fee reserves, the attacker has also seized code bases and coordinated with other team members in an attempt to seize control of Remilia’s social media. According to Fang, the attacker has managed to take over three X accounts, including Miladymaker and Remilionaire, while Remiliacorp has been locked out. “Treat those three accounts as compromised until further notice,” Fang stated, providing new official accounts, including RemiliaCorp333, MiladyMaker333 and RemilioBaby.

In May 2023, Milady NFTs were publicly endorsed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who posted a meme using imagery from the Milady NFT collection. The move triggered a rapid spike in the floor price of a Milady NFT, which subsequently surged from 3.8 Ether (ETH) to 7.8 ETH. At the time of writing, the floor price of a Milady NFT is 2.86 ETH, down about 15% over the past 24 hours, according to data from OpenSea.

In a filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the insurer attached an exclusion to the document, mentioning that the bond does not cover any “loss, damage, claim, occurrence, or suit related to NFTs.” The filing defined NFTs as: With the section attached to the policy, any losses related to NFTs will not be covered by the insurer. However, while NFTs are excluded from the policy, the document also clarifies that “cryptocurrency” is not included in its definition of NFTs. NFTs gained popularity in the bull market of 2021, with various celebrities and companies jumping on the trend.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/metaverse-dead-united-states-thriving-asia-sandbox-sebastien-borget",
    "fullContent": "Sandbox co-founder Sebastien Borget says the metaverse sector is thriving in Hong Kong, Korea and Japan.\nThe metaverse might feel like it’s “dead” for users living in the United States, but the industry is thriving throughout Asia, says The Sandbox’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Sebastien Borget. Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Asian Blockchain Gaming Alliance’s Web3 Summit in Singapore on Sept. 12, Borget said that over the last year, roughly 50% of Sandbox’s business has come from several countries in Asia. “If you don\u0027t focus on Asia, you will think the metaverse is dead from the North American and the Western side,” said Borget. Meanwhile, Borget noted that he is soon to announce the launch of Lion City on stage at Token 2049 in Singapore, a new neighborhood of 512 virtual land plots in the Sandbox metaverse, that aims to showcase Singapore’s culture through a partnership with a number of global brands. Borget detailed how The Sandbox had just closed a major virtual land sale in Turkey, where the metaverse has what he described as a “big ecosystem.” “The Sandbox ecosystem has grown to well over 400 brands, 700 partners around the world and 200 verified agencies that are building on Sandbox,” he added. Despite the slowing use of the metaverse in the West, Borget looked to a number of new developments in the Web3 and virtual reality sector more broadly with a sense of optimism. The first notable development was the introduction of dynamic NFTs, which allow the creators to alter the metadata and change the appearance and features of a given asset. “We often do this comparison with the real world, where it\u0027s like: if I buy a tennis racket — is it the same if I buy it, and it has been used by Pete Sampras, before or after?” Borget jested. Additionally, Borget noted the release of Apple’s Augmented Reality Vision Pro headset as a major step forward for the metaverse industry, with the extended-reality features allowing for digital assets in physical environments to look just as real as real ones. “This leads to digital assets becoming even closer to you. Instead of just sitting in a wallet that you have to open in a certain browser or application page, but in your surrounding environment,” Borget explained. Ultimately, Borget concluded that there’s no right or wrong way for the metaverse sector to foster widespread Web3 adoption. “There’s a good position of the traditional gaming industry that believes Web3 adoption will only come if you provide games that provide the same level of quality as Web2 games where blockchain is a feature.” While Borget admitted that might be a strong use case for many gaming companies in the space, he noted that metaverses like The Sandbox help create new experiences for users that differ from the world of traditional gaming.

The two venues were being built on Salesforce Park and were going to be dubbed the “Sho Restaurant” and “Sho Club Sky Lounge.” The latter would only be accessible to holders of the Sho Club NFTs, which cost anywhere from $7,500 to $300,000, and offered access to other future Sho Group hospitality offerings. Speaking with San Francisco-focused news website SFGATE on Sept. 7, Sho Group CEO Joshua Sigel stated that it was no longer possible to build the project and confirmed that the company ended its lease agreement in July. The CEO added: “Despite a strong demand for the concept with millions of dollars in both pre-sold and reserved memberships [...] we ultimately could not address the many concerns brought about by potential investors, most of which have been around the future of SF and the rising costs of constructing the restaurant.” Sigel went on to highlight difficult macro factors that ended up making construction costs too expensive, such as “labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical uncertainty, and inflation.” Sigel says Sho Group has refunded everyone who bought the NFTs. Binance’s NFT marketplace suddenly announced that it would soon wind down support for Polygon-based NFTs but did not provide a clear explanation as to why. In a Sept. 8 blog post, Binance NFT stated that it will discontinue its The Sandbox NFT Staking Program later this month, citing a decision to streamline product offerings on the platform. The program allows users to stake their Polygon-based Land NFTs from The Sandbox to earn SAND token rewards; however, it will officially shut down on Sept. 26. Users will have their NFTs automatically unstaked and returned to the spot wallets. As part of the closure of the program, Binance NFT also stated that support for the Polygon network will come to an end on the same day, with users being given until Dec. 31 to withdraw all their Polygon NFTs from the marketplace. Explaining the move, all Binance NFT stated was that “more details will be provided to impacted users at a later date.” To celebrate the new NFL season that kicked off this week, NFT-friendly social media platform Reddit launched NFL-themed NFT avatar collectibles.

There are 500 tokens available per team; however, at the time of writing, it appears that many of the sets have more than 400 NFTs still available, suggesting there hasn’t been any rush to snap them up yet. As part of a partnership with NBA star Paul George and popular sock, underwear and T-shirt brand Stance, NFT project Rumble Kong League has dropped phygital basketball socks.

    "fullContent": "As part of the restructuring efforts at Rario, a number of roles are also being eliminated, according to a report.\nRario, a Polygon-based platform issuing cricket-related nonfungible tokens (NFTs), has reportedly seen its founders leave the firm after two years after launching. Rario CEO Ankit Wadhwa and chief technology officer Sunny Bhanot are being pushed out as investors at the startup take greater control, TechCrunch reported on Sept. 8. Dream11, a major Indian fantasy sports platform and the largest backer of Rario, is also being ousted, according to the report. A number of roles are being removed as part of other restructuring efforts as well. Besides Dream11, Rario has several other prominent investors, including the global investment company Alpha Wave Global and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. In April 2022, the cricket NFT platform raised $120 million in a Series A funding round, claiming that it had the largest share of cricket NFT rights, with 900 cricketers at the time. This latest reported shakeup comes amid Dream11’s parent firm, Dream Sports, allegedly making efforts to reduce costs at the company. According to TechCrunch, Dream Sports is currently negotiating many of the licensing deals that Rario had signed to cut the expenses. Related: Google will allow ads for NFT games starting Sept. 15 At the time of writing, the reported changes are not reflected on the executives’ LinkedIn profiles. Rario and Dream11 did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Rario was founded in 2021 with a mission to create digital cricket collectibles and help fans engage as an online community. As of April 2021, the firm said it sold 50,000 NFTs to sports fans across 20 countries. Some of the cricket leagues signed by Rario include Cricket Australia, the Australian Cricketers’ Association, the Caribbean Premier League, the Lanka Premier League and Abu Dhabi T10 League Legends League Cricket.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-opensea-and-how-to-use-it",
    "fullContent": "This guide delves into the significance of the OpenSea decentralized marketplace, its pros and cons, and its role in the NFT revolution.\nThe rise of nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces has ushered in a new era, fundamentally reshaping the way we perceive and interact with digital assets. They provide a new medium for artists to showcase their creations and establish a direct and meaningful connection with their audience. OpenSea has taken center stage in this revolution. OpenSea, the brainchild of Alex Atallah and Devin Finzer, came into existence in 2017. Their mission was clear: to establish an open and user-friendly marketplace for NFTs. Recognizing the transformative potential of these assets, the founders aimed to provide an NFT platform that would enable creators and collectors to actively engage in the emerging digital ownership economy. As the popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) soared, OpenSea deftly expanded its horizons to encompass a wider array of blockchain networks and standards. This strategic move allowed the platform to welcome the diverse spectrum of NFT projects that were taking shape, ensuring it could cater to an ever-growing audience. OpenSea’s commitment to embracing interoperability and inclusivity further solidified its reputation as a premier NFT marketplace. OpenSea operates as a blockchain-based aggregator marketplace designed for buying, selling and trading NFTs. It functions much like well-known e-commerce platforms such as eBay or Etsy but in a decentralized way. In parallel to these platforms, OpenSea facilitates transactions between individuals, but with a unique twist: It deals solely with NFTs of various kinds, ranging from art, music, collectibles, virtual lands, sports assets and domain names to utility NFTs like membership passes. The platform’s distinctive feature lies in its non-custodial approach. Transactions occur through self-executing smart contracts, ensuring a fair and secure exchange. Despite the absence of intermediaries, OpenSea collects a 2.5% fee from all secondary sales, which helps cover the operational costs of the platform. Apart from supporting the Ethereum standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155, OpenSea has seamlessly incorporated protocols for various other blockchains, including Solana and Polygon, among others. Thus, due to the often exorbitant transaction fees on the Ethereum network, OpenSea incorporates the Polygon blockchain, a layer-2 scaling solution, enabling swifter and more cost-effective transactions. Transitioning between the Polygon and Ethereum networks on OpenSea is a straightforward process achieved with just a single click of a button. This user-friendly feature is particularly beneficial for newcomers, ensuring a smooth experience. As for OpenSea’s infrastructure, in 2022, the platform announced a significant overhaul, transitioning from the Wyvern protocol to its newly developed Seaport protocol. The motivation behind this transition was to streamline operations and enhance the marketplace’s efficiency, with the potential to reduce transaction costs substantially on the platform. Additionally, the protocol enhances the legibility and comprehension of wallet signatures, further improving the user experience. The OpenSea NFT marketplace boasts a set of distinctive features that underpin its popularity and utility, including minting functionality, transparent transactions and reduced gas fees enabled by layer-2 solutions, personalized storefronts, educational resources, and more. Key features of OpenSea include: When evaluating the pros and cons of OpenSea, certain aspects stand out. On the positive side, OpenSea offers a user-friendly and uncomplicated experience. It’s open to all users without any associated costs. The platform imposes minimal fees on NFT sales, enhancing its appeal. Additionally, the availability of multiple blockchains provides alternatives in order to circumvent Ethereum’s elevated transaction fees. However, on the flip side, OpenSea’s exclusive reliance on cryptocurrency for payments might limit accessibility for those accustomed to traditional payment methods. Due to the open nature of the platform, there’s a risk of encountering low-quality or fraudulent NFT listings. Furthermore, OpenSea lacks comprehensive regulations and a fully decentralized governance model, which could impact its decision-making processes and alignment with decentralized principles. Before jumping into using OpenSea, there are a few important steps to take to ensure one can make the most of the platform. Newcomers should sign up on the official OpenSea website. Users should ensure that they have an Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, ready for seamless interaction. The next step is to choose a compatible wallet and install it as a currency repository for transactions. Then, users need to fund their wallet and create an OpenSea account by logging in via the “Connect Wallet” tab in the “Menu” section. Ether (ETH) is the primary currency for NFT trading on OpenSea, but Wrapped Ether (wETH) is used within smart contracts for smoother integration. While ETH and wETH are preferred, over 150 other tokens are accepted. Browse diverse NFT categories using filters and options. Click on an NFT’s name or thumbnail for detailed information about the item, creator and pricing. Choose “Buy Now” or “Place Bid” based on the listing type. Users need to confirm the transaction through their wallet to complete the ownership transfer. To mint an NFT, start by creating a listing in your profile’s “Create” section. Upload visuals and details, customize the OpenSea URL, and set price or auction parameters. The next step is to confirm the transaction and mint the NFT. To cancel a listing, click “Cancel Listing” in the top right of the item’s page. Be aware of associated gas fees, which fluctuate based on network activity. In the face of an ever-evolving NFT landscape, OpenSea persists in its journey of evolution and innovation. The platform’s adaptability to new trends and asset categories, along with its commitment to efficiency and community engagement, bodes well for its continued prominence. As competitors mature, OpenSea faces intensified competition, particularly in terms of activity volume, which has been a defining factor for its success. Despite hurdles, OpenSea is poised to shape the digital ownership realm, leading the way in redefining our interaction with art, commerce and ownership in an era of advancing technology and digital assets.",

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/providing-value-to-gamers-in-a-changing-web3-landscape-interview-with-tokyo-beast",
    "fullContent": "The gaming industry is at a pivotal crossroads, where the transition from Web2 to Web3 gaming has become the focal point of innovation and transformation.\nIn the ever-evolving digital landscape, the distinction between Web2 and Web3 gaming has gained exponential significance. Web2 gaming is typically characterized by centralized, self-contained ecosystems, while Web3 gaming embraces blockchain technology, decentralization and the concept of players owning in-game assets. The shift from Web2 to Web3 gaming has emerged as a central point of innovation and transformation within the gaming industry. In this interview, Naoki Motohashi, the producer of TOKYO BEAST, a crypto-entertainment IP project, delves into the dynamics of this profound shift in gaming paradigms. With a substantial background as a producer in Web2 social games, Motohashi provides his perspective on the driving forces behind this transition and the reasons why Web3 gaming is poised to reshape the gaming landscape. Cointelegraph: Tell us more about your background and how you became the producer of TOKYO BEAST. Naoki Motohashi: I was originally a producer of Web2 social games. However, when I received an offer from a contact to develop TOKYO BEAST, I accepted because I wanted to take on the challenge of Web3. CT: What inspired you to move from Web2 social games to Web3 games? NM: I believed that with Web3, we could create a unique and entertaining experience that wasn’t possible with Web2. CT: What are your thoughts on the current state of the Web3 gaming market? NM: Although it’s an extremely attractive market with great potential for hits, I think there are still a lot of immature products in terms of content. As Web3 technology develops, we need more content-rich games to expand the market. CT: Can you provide a brief overview of what TOKYO BEAST is and what makes it unique in the Web3 gaming space? NM: TOKYO BEAST is not just another Web3 game. We’re aiming for a true crypto entertainment IP project where Web3, Web2, the game’s universe, real-world gameplay, investment value and content entertainment all organically merge. Introducing #TOKYOBEAST: The Crypto-Entertainment IP Project. Dive into a groundbreaking entertainment experience powered by crypto. A century from now in Tokyo, unparalleled adventures and thrills await you.https://t.co/XhghAb8ztV pic.twitter.com/BZg407pGzL CT: What are some of the key features and strengths of TOKYO BEAST? NM: The features we’ll release initially — Base, Farm, Trials and Betting — allow users with different preferences to enjoy their own experience. They are all interconnected through a universe and ecosystem, offering a new entertainment experience that transcends the boundaries between Web2 and Web3. CT: Are you planning to expand your audience beyond the existing Web3 user base, and if so, what’s your strategy? NM: Yes, we aim to attract a large number of Web2 users using our proprietary NFT proxy model, not just Web3 users. CT: Can you explain what this NFT proxy model is? NM: Players can use copy data from the BEAST NFTs owned by NFT holders to play the game. The value of an NFT holder’s BEAST NFT is determined by the performance of the BEAST NFT copy data in the game. This eliminates entry barriers such as initial NFT purchase and connecting one’s wallet, which are typical of other Web3 games, while maintaining the rarity of the NFTs by limiting their quantity. CT: Can you give us a glimpse of the TOKYO BEAST’s future milestones? NM: First, next year, we plan to release the functions Base, Farm, Trials and Betting, coinciding with the issuance of our proprietary cryptocurrency TBZ and an NFT sale. We also have plans for various project releases to expand the TOKYO BEAST universe and increase the utility of TBZ. CT: What can viewers expect from the upcoming Polygon livestream event? Can you give us any more details? NM: The livestream is our first opportunity to talk directly to our users, and I’d love to see just one more person come out to appreciate and support TOKYO BEAST. The livestream event is scheduled to take place this Friday, Sept. 8, at 8 pm EST. Join us live with @yoriko09 from @PolygonGaming for an exclusive first look at #TOKYOBEAST, an innovative Triple-A Web3 game! Tune in for a chance to win an epic NFT prize! Date: Friday, September 8th Time: 8 PM (EST), 5PM (PST) Where: https://t.co/eND5vXeoK1 pic.twitter.com/Z0jIdl5FsR What makes this event special is the lineup of speakers we have. We’re honored to have Yoriko Beal, Polygon’s head of business development in Japan, joining us. Her insights into the industry and Polygon’s role in it will provide valuable perspectives. CT: The gaming industry is rapidly evolving. How does TOKYO BEAST plan to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to changing trends? NM: Our primary goal is to deliver true crypto entertainment that transcends the boundaries of Web2 and Web3. We also aim to launch projects that expand the TOKYO BEAST universe in line with evolving trends and technology, focusing on providing value to all our fans. Disclaimer.

    "absoluteURL": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/onchainmonkey-nft-collection-migrate-ethereum-to-bitcoin",
    "fullContent": "Metagood CEO Danny Yang attributed the move to the Bitcoin network being seen as a more secure platform for its users, among other reasons.\nThe team behind nonfungible token collection OnChainMonkey is shifting its entire collection of 10,000 NFTs from Ethereum to Bitcoin, in a massive undertaking expected to take several months. \"A historical transition is on the horizon as we prepare to migrate our flagship collection, OCM Genesis, from Ethereum to Bitcoin,” Metagood co-founder and CEO Danny Yang said in a statement on Sept. 7. The OnChainMonkeys were first launched in September 2021 on Ethereum, but Yang said the migration to Bitcoin Ordinals was due to its community seeing Bitcoin as offering a more secure platform for its users. The proposal to migrate to Bitcoin was passed by 99% of OnChainMonkey tokenholders. Yang said this means the community had a high conviction for moving to Bitcoin. The migration would come at a hefty cost though, with Metagood expecting to fork out over $1 million to ensure the migration process runs smoothly. Why is the Art and Collectibles market significant for Bitcoin? Why should this matter to you? 1. Valuable Market. The wealth associated from art and collectibles by ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) *alone* accounts for $1.5 TRILLION in value according to Deloitte\u0027s… While the migration process is rather complex, each new OnChainMonkey on Bitcoin will have clear provenance to the corresponding original Ethereum NFT. Holders will receive the corresponding Bitcoin Ordinal once they’ve burned the Ethereum NFT. However, Yang says the migration shouldn’t be too challenging compared to what Metagood has already accomplished in the Bitcoin Ordinals space: However, Ethereum continues to dominate the NFT market, settling $236.8 million in NFTs over the last month, compared to second place Solana ($37.7 million), with Bitcoin ($11.1 million) back in sixth place, according to CryptoSlam. At the same time, Bitcoin Ordinals transaction volumes plunged 98% between May and mid-August despite rising to popularity in early 2023. Bitcoin Ordinals is dead. Bitcoin is dead. We heard this many many times over the years. In the case of Bitcoin Ordinals, let\u0027s actually understand what actually is dead. 1. Bitcoin Ordinals is a new protocol at release 0.8.2. It\u0027s an early release of a protocol that still… https://t.co/NxJP7YY64y But Yang isn’t concerned, highlighting to Cointelegraph that it is only time before a strong Bitcoin-native NFT ecosystem develops. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum NFT ecosystems can thrive, he added. Related: Ordinals still make up majority of Bitcoin txs despite price collapse OnChainMonkey NFTs currently trade at an average floor price of 1.10 Ether (ETH) with over 20,550 ETH in transaction volume from 9,500 items since it launched on NFT marketplace OpenSea in September 2021. Of the 2,900 owners of the OnChainMonkey NFTs, 31% are unique owners, according to OpenSea. The arrival of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens launched in January, which were made possible by the Taproot soft fork executed in November 2021.
